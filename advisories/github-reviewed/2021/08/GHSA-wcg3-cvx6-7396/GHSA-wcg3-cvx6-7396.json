  "summary": "Segmentation fault in time",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nUnix-like operating systems may segfault due to dereferencing a dangling pointer in specific circumstances. This requires an environment variable to be set in a different thread than the affected functions. This may occur without the user's knowledge, notably in a third-party library.\n\nThe affected functions from time 0.2.7 through 0.2.22 are:\n\n- `time::UtcOffset::local_offset_at`\n- `time::UtcOffset::try_local_offset_at`\n- `time::UtcOffset::current_local_offset`\n- `time::UtcOffset::try_current_local_offset`\n- `time::OffsetDateTime::now_local`\n- `time::OffsetDateTime::try_now_local`\n\nThe affected functions in time 0.1 (all versions) are:\n\n- `at`\n- `at_utc`\n- `now`\n\nNon-Unix targets (including Windows and wasm) are unaffected.\n\n### Patches\n\nIn some versions of time`, the internal method that determines the local offset has been modified to always return `None` on the affected operating systems. This has the effect of returning an `Err` on the `try_*` methods and `UTC` on the non-`try_*` methods. In later versions, `time` will attempt to determine the number of threads running in the process. If the process is single-threaded, the call will proceed as its safety invariant is upheld.\n\nUsers and library authors with time in their dependency tree must perform `cargo update`, which will pull in the updated, unaffected code.\n\nUsers of time 0.1 do not have a patch and must upgrade to an unaffected version: time 0.2.23 or greater or the 0.3 series.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nLibrary authors must ensure that the program only has one running thread at the time of calling any affected method. Binary authors may do the same and/or ensure that no other thread is actively mutating the environment.\n\n### References\n\ntime-rs/time#293.",
