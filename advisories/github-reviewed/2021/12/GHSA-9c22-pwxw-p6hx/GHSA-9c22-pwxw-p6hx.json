  "summary": "OpenZeppelin Contracts initializer reentrancy may lead to double initialization",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nInitializer functions that are invoked separate from contract creation (the most prominent example being minimal proxies) may be reentered if they make an untrusted non-view external call.\n\nOnce an initializer has finished running it can never be re-executed. However, an exception put in place to support multiple inheritance made reentrancy possible in the scenario described above, breaking the expectation that there is a single execution.\n\nNote that upgradeable proxies are commonly initialized together with contract creation, where reentrancy is not feasible, so the impact of this issue is believed to be minor.\n\n### Patches\n\nA fix is included in the version v4.4.1 of `@openzeppelin/contracts` and `@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable`.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAvoid untrusted external calls during initialization.\n\n### References\nhttps://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3006\n\n### Credits\n\nThis issue was identified and reported by @chaitinblockchain through [our bug bounty on Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/bounty/openzeppelin/).\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, or need assistance executing the mitigation, email us at security@openzeppelin.com.\n",
