  "summary": "Member account takeover",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nAn error in the implementation of the member email change functionality allows unauthenticated users to change the email address of arbitrary member accounts to one they control by crafting a request to the relevant API endpoint, and validating the new address via magic link sent to the new email address.\n\nGhost(Pro) has already been patched. Self-hosters are impacted if running Ghost a version between 3.18.0 and 4.15.0 with members functionality enabled.\n\n### Patches\n\nFixed in 4.15.1, all 4.x sites should upgrade as soon as possible.\nFixed in 3.42.6, all 3.x sites should upgrade as soon as possible.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe patch in 4.15.1 and 3.42.6 adds a new authenticated endpoint for updating member email addresses. Updating Ghost is the quickest complete solution.\n\nAs a workaround, if for any reason you cannot update your Ghost instance, you can block the `POST /members/api/send-magic-link/` endpoint, which will also disable member login and signup for your site.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Email us at [security@ghost.org](mailto:security@ghost.org)\n",
