  "details": "Jenkins Dashboard View Plugin 2.15 and earlier does not escape URLs referenced in Image Dashboard Portlets, resulting in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with View/Configure permission.\n\nAs part of this fix, the property for image URLs was changed from `url` to `imageUrl`. Existing [Configuration as Code](https://plugins.jenkins.io/configuration-as-code/) configurations are still supported, but exports will emit the new property.",
