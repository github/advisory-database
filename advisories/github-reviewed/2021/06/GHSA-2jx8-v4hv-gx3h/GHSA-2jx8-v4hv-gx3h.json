  "summary": "XXE vulnerability in Launch import",
  "details": "| Release Date | Affected Projects | Affected Versions | Access Vector| Security Risk |\n|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Monday, May 4, 2020| [service-api](https://github.com/reportportal/service-api) | Every version, starting from 3.1.0 | Remote | Medium |\n\n### Impact\nStarting from version 3.1.0 we introduced a new feature of JUnit XML launch import. Unfortunately XML parser was not configured properly to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks. This allows a user to import a specifically-crafted XML file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from Report Portal service-api module or server-side request forgery.\n\nReport Portal versions 4.3.12+ and 5.1.1+ disables external entity resolution for theirs XML parser.\n\nWe advise our users install the latest releases we built specifically to address this issue.\n\n### Patches\nFixed with https://github.com/reportportal/service-api/pull/1201\n\n### Binary Download\nhttps://bintray.com/epam/reportportal/service-api/5.1.1\nhttps://bintray.com/epam/reportportal/service-api/4.3.12\n\n### Docker Container Download\n* RP v4: `docker pull reportportal/service-api:4.3.12`\n* RP v5: `docker pull reportportal/service-api:5.1.1`\n\n### Acknowledgement\nThe issue was reported to Report Portal Team by an external security researcher.\nOur Team thanks Julien M. for reporting the issue.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory email us: [support@reportportal.io](mailto:support@reportportal.io)",
