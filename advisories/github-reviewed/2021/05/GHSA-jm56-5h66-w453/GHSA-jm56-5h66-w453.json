  "summary": "Repository index file allows for duplicates of the same chart entry in helm",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nDuring a security audit of Helm's code base, security researchers at Trail of Bits identified a bug in which the a Helm repository can contain duplicates of the same chart, with the last one always used. If a repository is compromised, this lowers the level of access that an attacker needs to inject a bad chart into a repository.\n\nTo perform this attack, an attacker must have write access to the index file (which can occur during a MITM attack on a non-SSL connection).\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue has been patched in Helm 3.3.2 and 2.16.11\n\n### Workarounds\n\n- do not install charts from repositories you do not trust\n- fetch charts using a secure channel of communication (such as TLS)\n- use `helm pull` to fetch the chart, then review the chart’s content (either manually, or with `helm verify` if it has been signed) to ensure it has not been tampered with\n- manually review the index file in the Helm repository cache before installing software.",
