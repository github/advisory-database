  "details": "### Impact\n\nIf your installation is using the `export-importer` service, there is potential impact.\nIf your installation is not importing keys via the `export-importer` services, your installation is not impacted.\n\nIn versions `0.19.1` and earlier, the `export-importer` service assumed that the server it was importing from had properly embargoed keys for at least 2 hours after their expiry time. There are now known instances of servers that did not properly embargo keys.\n\nThis could allow allow for imported keys to be re-published before they have expired, allowing for potential replay of RPIs.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis is patched in `v0.18.3` and all versions `0.19.2` and later.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nEnsure that the servers you are importing export zip files from are not publishing keys too early. \n\n### References\n\nn/a\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory\n* Open an issue in [exposure-notifications-server](https://github.com/google/exposure-notifications-server/)\n* Email us at [exposure-notifications-feedback@google.com](mailto:exposure-notifications-feedback@google.com)",
