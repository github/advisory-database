  "summary": "Path traversal and files overwrite with unsquashfs in singularity",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nDue to insecure handling of path traversal and the lack of path sanitization within `unsquashfs` (a distribution provided utility used by Singularity), it is possible to overwrite/create any files on the host filesystem during the extraction of a crafted squashfs filesystem.\n\nSquashfs extraction occurs automatically for unprivileged execution of Singularity (either `--without-suid` installation or with `allow setuid = no`) when a user attempts to run an image which:\n\n- is a local SIF image or a single file containing a squashfs filesystem\n- is pulled from remote sources `library://` or `shub://`\n\nImage build is also impacted in a more serious way as it is often performed by the root user, allowing an attacker to overwrite/create files leading to a system compromise.  Bootstrap methods `library`, `shub` and `localimage` trigger a squashfs extraction.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue is addressed in Singularity 3.6.4.\n\nAll users are advised to upgrade to 3.6.4 especially if they use Singularity mainly for building image as root user.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere is no solid workaround except to temporarily avoid use of unprivileged mode with single file images, in favor of sandbox images instead. Regarding image build, temporarily avoid building from `library` and `shub` sources, and as much as possible use `--fakeroot` or a VM to limit potential impact.\n\n### For more information\n\nGeneral questions about the impact of the advisory / changes made in the 3.6.0 release can be asked in the:\n\n* [Singularity Slack Channel](https://bit.ly/2m0g3lX)\n* [Singularity Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/a/lbl.gov/forum/??sdf%7Csort:date#!forum/singularity)\n\nAny sensitive security concerns should be directed to: security@sylabs.io\n\nSee our Security Policy here: https://sylabs.io/security-policy",
