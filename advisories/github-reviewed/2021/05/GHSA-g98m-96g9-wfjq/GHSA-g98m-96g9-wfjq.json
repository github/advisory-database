  "summary": "Insecure path handling in Bundler",
  "details": "Bundler prior to 2.1.0 uses a predictable path in /tmp/, created with insecure permissions as a storage location for gems, if locations under the user's home directory are not available. If Bundler is used in a scenario where the user does not have a writable home directory, an attacker could place malicious code in this directory that would be later loaded and executed.",
