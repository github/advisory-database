  "details": "@alovak found that currently when we build hash of account number we do not \"salt\" it. Which makes it vulnerable to rainbow table attack.\n\n**What did you expect to see?**\nI expected salt (some random number from configuration) to be used in [hash.AccountNumber](https://github.com/moov-io/customers/blob/master/pkg/secrets/hash/account_number.go#L13)\n\nI would generate salt per tenant at least (maybe per organization).",
