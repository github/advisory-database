  "summary": "Cross-Site Request Forgery allowing sending of test emails and generation of node auto-deployment keys",
  "details": "### Impact\nDue to improperly configured CSRF protections on two routes, a malicious user could execute a CSRF-based attack against the following endpoints:\n\n* Sending a test email.\n* Generating a node auto-deployment token.\n\nAt no point would any data be exposed to the malicious user, this would simply trigger email spam to an administrative user, or generate a single auto-deployment token unexpectedly. This token is not revealed to the malicious user, it is simply created unexpectedly in the system.\n\n### Patches\nThis has been addressed in https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/commit/bf9cbe2c6d5266c6914223e067c56175de7fc3a5 which will be released as `1.6.6`.\n\n### Workarounds\nUsers may optionally manually apply the fixes released in v1.6.6 to patch their own systems.\n",
