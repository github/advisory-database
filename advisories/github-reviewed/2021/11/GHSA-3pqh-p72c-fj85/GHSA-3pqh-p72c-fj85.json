  "summary": "Improper Preservation of Permissions in github.com/cloudflare/cfrpki/cmd/octorpki",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nWhen copying files with rsync, octorpki uses the \"-a\" flag 0, which forces rsync to copy binaries with the suid bit set as root. Since the provided service definition defaults to root (https://github.com/cloudflare/cfrpki/blob/master/package/octorpki.service) this could allow for a vector, when combined with another vulnerability that causes octorpki to process a malicious TAL file, for a local privilege escalation.  \n\n## For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory email us at security@cloudflare.com",
