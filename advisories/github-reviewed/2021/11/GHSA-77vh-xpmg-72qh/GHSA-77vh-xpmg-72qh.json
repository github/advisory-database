  "details": "### Impact\nIn the OCI Image Specification version 1.0.1 and prior, manifest and index documents are not self-describing and documents with a single digest could be interpreted as either a manifest or an index.\n\n### Patches\nThe Image Specification will be updated to recommend that both manifest and index documents contain a `mediaType` field to identify the type of document.\nRelease [v1.0.2](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/releases/tag/v1.0.2) includes these updates.\n\n### Workarounds\nSoftware attempting to deserialize an ambiguous document may reject the document if it contains both “manifests” and “layers” fields or “manifests” and “config” fields.\n\n### References\nhttps://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/security/advisories/GHSA-mc8v-mgrf-8f4m\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec\n* Email us at [security@opencontainers.org](mailto:security@opencontainers.org)\n* https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/commits/v1.0.2\n",
