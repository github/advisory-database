  "summary": "Missing Authorization with Default Settings in Dashboard UI",
  "details": "Dashboard UI in Hangfire.Core uses authorization filters to protect it from showing sensitive data to unauthorized users. By default when no custom authorization filters specified, `LocalRequestsOnlyAuthorizationFilter` filter is being used to allow only local requests and prohibit all the remote requests to provide sensible, protected by default settings.\n\nHowever due to the recent changes, in version 1.7.25 no authorization filters are used by default, allowing remote requests to succeed.\n\n### Impact\n\nMissing authorization when default options are used for the Dashboard UI, e.g. when no custom authorization rules are used as recommended in the [Using Dashboard](https://docs.hangfire.io/en/latest/configuration/using-dashboard.html#configuring-authorization) documentation article. \n\n#### Impacted\n\nIf you are using `UseHangfireDashboard` method with default `DashboardOptions.Authorization` property value, then your installation is impacted:\n\n```csharp\napp.UseHangfireDashboard(); // Impacted\napp.UseHangfireDashboard(\"/hangfire\", new DashboardOptions()); // Impacted\n```\n\n#### Not Impacted\n\nIf any other authorization filter is specified in the `DashboardOptions.Authorization` property, the you are not impacted:\n\n```csharp\napp.UseHangfireDashboard(\"/hangfire\", new DashboardOptions\n{\n    Authorization = new []{ new SomeAuthorizationFilter(); } // Not impacted\n});\n```\n\n### Patches\n\nPatch is already available in version [1.7.26](https://github.com/HangfireIO/Hangfire/releases/tag/v1.7.26) and already available on NuGet.org, please see [Hangfire.Core 1.7.26](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Hangfire.Core/1.7.26). Default authorization rules now prohibit remote requests by default again by including the `LocalRequestsOnlyAuthorizationFilter` filter to the default settings. Please upgrade to the newest version in order to mitigate the issue.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIt is possible to fix the issue by using the `LocalRequestsOnlyAuthorizationFilter` explicitly when configuring the Dashboard UI. In this case upgrade is not required.\n\n```csharp\n// using Hangfire.Dashboard;\n\napp.UseHangfireDashboard(\"/hangfire\", new DashboardOptions\n{\n    Authorization = new []{ new LocalRequestsOnlyAuthorizationFilter(); }\n});\n```\n\n### References\n\nOriginal GitHub Issue: https://github.com/HangfireIO/Hangfire/issues/1958",
