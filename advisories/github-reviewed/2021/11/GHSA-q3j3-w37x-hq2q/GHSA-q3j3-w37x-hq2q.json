  "summary": "Webcache Poisoning in symfony/http-kernel",
  "details": "Description\n-----------\n\nWhen a Symfony application is running behind a proxy or a load-balancer, you can tell Symfony to look for the `X-Forwarded-*` HTTP headers. HTTP headers that are not part of the \"trusted_headers\" allowed list are ignored and protect you from \"Cache poisoning\" attacks. \n\nIn Symfony 5.2, we've added support for the `X-Forwarded-Prefix` header, but this header was accessible in sub-requests, even if it was not part of the \"trusted_headers\" allowed list. An attacker could leverage this opportunity to forge requests containing a `X-Forwarded-Prefix` HTTP header, leading to a web cache poisoning issue.\n\nResolution\n----------\n\nSymfony now ensures that the `X-Forwarded-Prefix` HTTP header is not forwarded to sub-requests when it is not trusted.\n\nThe patch for this issue is available [here](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/95dcf51682029e89450aee86267e3d553aa7c487) for branch 5.3.\n\nCredits\n-------\n\nWe would like to thank Soner Sayakci for reporting the issue and Jérémy Derussé for fixing the issue.\n",
