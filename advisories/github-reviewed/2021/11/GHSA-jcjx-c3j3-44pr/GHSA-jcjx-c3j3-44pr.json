  "summary": "Insufficient Session Expiration in @cyyynthia/tokenize",
  "details": "### Impact\nA bug introduced in version 1.1.0 made Tokenize generate faulty tokens with NaN as a generation date. As a result, tokens would not properly expire and remain valid regardless of the `lastTokenReset` field.\n\n### Patches\nVersion 1.1.3 contains a patch that'll invalidate these faulty tokens and make new ones behave as expected.\n\n### Workarounds\nNone. Tokens do not hold the necessary information to perform invalidation anymore.\n\n### References\nPR #1\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [github.com/cyyynthia/tokenize](https://github.com/cyyynthia/tokenize)\n* Email us at [cynthia@cynthia.dev](mailto:cynthia@cynthia.dev)\n",
