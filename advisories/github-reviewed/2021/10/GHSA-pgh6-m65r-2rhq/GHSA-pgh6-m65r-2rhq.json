By default, it is `false`.\n\n### Patches\nThe issue has been patched in `fastify-static@4.4.1`\n\n### Workarounds\nIf updating is not an option, you can sanitize the input URLs using the [`rewriteUrl`](https://www.fastify.io/docs/latest/Server/#rewriteurl) server option.\n\n### References\n\n+ Bug founder: drstrnegth\n+ [hackerone Report](https://hackerone.com/reports/1361804)\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [fastify-static](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-static)\n* Contact the [security team](https://github.com/fastify/fastify/blob/main/SECURITY.md#the-fastify-security-team)\n",
