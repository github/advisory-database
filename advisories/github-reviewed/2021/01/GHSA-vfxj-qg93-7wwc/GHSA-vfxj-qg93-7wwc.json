  "summary": "Sessions could be hijacked due to tracking contacts by an auto-incremented ID in Mautic",
  "details": "### Impact\nAn issue was discovered in Mautic 1.x and 2.x before 2.13.0. It is possible to systematically emulate tracking cookies per contact due to tracking the contact by their auto-incremented ID. Thus, a third party can manipulate the cookie value with +1 to systematically assume being tracked as each contact in Mautic. It is then possible to retrieve information about the contact through forms that have progressive profiling enabled.\n\n### Patches\nUpdate to 2.13.0 or later\n\n### Workarounds\nNone\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Email us at [security@mautic.org](mailto:security@mautic.org)",
