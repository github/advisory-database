  "summary": "Rating Script Service expose XWiki to SQL injection",
  "details": "### Impact\nThis issue impacts only XWiki with the Ratings API installed.\nThe Rating Script Service expose an API to perform SQL requests without escaping the from and where search arguments. \nThis might lead to an SQL script injection quite easily for any user having Script rights on XWiki.\n\n### Patches\nThe problem has been patched in XWiki 12.9RC1.\n\n### Workarounds\nThe only workaround besides upgrading XWiki would be to uninstall the Ratings API in XWiki from the Extension Manager.\n\n### References\nhttps://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-17662\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [Jira XWiki](http://jira.xwiki.org)\n* Email us at our [security mailing list](mailto:security@xwiki.org)",
