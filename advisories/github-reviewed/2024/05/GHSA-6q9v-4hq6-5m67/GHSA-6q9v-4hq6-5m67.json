  "summary": "Doctrine SQL injection vulnerability",
  "details": "Doctrine is prone to SQL injection vulnerability. Users of Doctrine 1.2 and 2 should update to the newly released versions of both libraries immediately. Both versions only include the security fix and no other changes to their previous versions 1.2.3 and 2.0.2.\n\nAffected versions are:\n- 1.2.3 and earlier for PostgreSQL and DB2 Dialects\n- 2.0.2 and earlier\n\nThe security issue was found to affect the `Doctrine\\DBAL\\Platforms\\AbstractPlatform::modifyLimitQuery()` function which does not cast input values for limit and offset to integer and allows malicious SQL to be executed if these parameters are passed into Doctrine 2 directly from request variables without previous cast to integer. Functionality building on top using limit queries in the ORM such as `Doctrine\\ORM\\Query::setFirstResult()` and `Doctrine\\ORM\\Query::setMaxResults()` are also affected by this security issue.\n\nThe fix for this security issue breaks backwards compatibility for developers that extend the `Doctrine\\DBAL\\Platforms\\AbstractPlatform::modifyLimitQuery()` method, because it is now marked as final. Please overwrite the `Doctrine\\DBAL\\Platforms\\AbstractPlatform::doModifyLimitQuery()` method instead.",
