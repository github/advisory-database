  "details": "Today we are releasing Grafana 9.2.4. Alongside other bug fixes, this patch release includes critical security fixes for CVE-2022-39328.\n\nRelease 9.2.4, latest patch, also containing security fix:\n\n- [Download Grafana 9.2.4](https://grafana.com/grafana/download/9.2.4)\n\nAppropriate patches have been applied to [Grafana Cloud](https://grafana.com/cloud) and as always, we closely coordinated with all cloud providers licensed to offer Grafana Pro. They have received early notification under embargo and confirmed that their offerings are secure at the time of this announcement. This is applicable to Amazon Managed Grafana and Azure Managed Grafana as a service offering.\n\n## Privilege escalation\n\n### Summary\n\nInternal security audit identified a race condition in the Grafana codebase, which allowed an unauthenticated user to query an arbitrary endpoint in Grafana.\nA race condition in the [HTTP context creation](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/main/pkg/web/router.go#L153) could make a HTTP request being assigned the authentication/authorization middlewares of another call. Under heavy load it is possible that a call protected by a privileged middleware receives instead the middleware of a public query. \nAs a result, an unauthenticated user can successfully query protected endpoints.\n\nThe CVSS score for this vulnerability is [9.8 Critical](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H&version=3.1)\n\n### Impact\n\nUnauthenticated users can query arbitrary endpoints with malicious intent.\n\n### Impacted versions\n\nAll installations for Grafana versions >=9.2.x.\n\n### Solutions and mitigations\n\nTo fully address CVE-2022-39328, please upgrade your Grafana instances. \nAppropriate patches have been applied to [Grafana Cloud](https://grafana.com/cloud).\n\n## Reporting security issues\n\nIf you think you have found a security vulnerability, please send a report to security@grafana.com.
