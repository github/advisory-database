  "summary": "eZ Platform CSRF token in login form is disabled by default",
  "details": "his security advisory fixes a potential vulnerability in the eZ Platform log in form. That form has a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) token, but the CSRF functionality is not enabled by default, meaning the token is inactive. The fix is distributed via Composer as ezsystems/ezplatform v2.5.4, and in v3.0.0 when that will be released.\n\nIf you'd like to manually enable it in your configuration, this is done by editing your app/config/security.yml and setting the \"csrf_token_generator\" key to \"security.csrf.token_manager\", like this:\n```\nsecurity:\n    firewalls:\n        ezpublish_front:\n            form_login:\n                csrf_token_generator: security.csrf.token_manager\n```\nNB: In eZ Platform 3.0 this file has been moved to config/packages/security.yaml\n\n",
