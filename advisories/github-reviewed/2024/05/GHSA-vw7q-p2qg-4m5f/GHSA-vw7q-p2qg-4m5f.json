After analysis, this stored XSS could be used to elevate privileges from Editor to Admin.\n\nWe believe that this vulnerability is rated at CVSS 7.3 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N). \n\n### Impact\nAn attacker can exploit this vulnerability to escalate privilege from editor to admin by tricking an authenticated admin to click on a link.\n\n### Affected versions with HIGH severity \nAll Grafana >=8.0 versions are affected by this vulnerability.\n\n### Solutions and mitigations\n\nAll installations after Grafana v8.0 should be upgraded as soon as possible.\n\nAs a workaround it is possible to [disable alerting ](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/next/alerting/migrating-alerts/opt-out/#disable-alerting)or use [legacy alerting](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/next/alerting/migrating-alerts/opt-out/#staying-on-legacy-alerting).\n\nAppropriate patches have been applied to [Grafana Cloud](https://grafana.com/cloud) and as always, we closely coordinated with all cloud providers licensed to offer Grafana Pro. They have received early notification under embargo and confirmed that their offerings are secure at the time of this announcement. This is applicable to Amazon Managed Grafana.\n\n### Timeline\n\nHere is a detailed timeline starting from when we originally learned of the issue. All times in UTC.\n\n2022-06-19 10:32 - Research submission of vulnerability report\n2022-06-20 14:35- Issue triaged, confirmed positive, and internal incident raised\n2022-06-20 18:40 - Fix PR submitted and reviewed\n2022-06-23 07:12 - All Grafana Cloud hosted Grafana instances patched\n2022-07-05 07:14 - Customers informed under embargo\n2022-07-14 02:00 - Public release\n\n### Acknowledgement\n\nWe would like to thank Maxim Misharin for responsibly disclosing the vulnerability.\n\n### Reporting security issues\n\nIf you think you have found a security vulnerability, please send a report to security@grafana.com.
