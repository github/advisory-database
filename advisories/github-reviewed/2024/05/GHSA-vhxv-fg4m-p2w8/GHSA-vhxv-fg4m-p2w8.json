  "details": "### Impact\n\nSome CORS middleware (more specifically those created by specifying two or more origin patterns whose hosts share a proper suffix) incorrectly allow some untrusted origins, thereby opening the door to cross-origin attacks from the untrusted origins in question.\n\nFor example, specifying origin patterns `https://foo.com` and `https://bar.com` (in that order) would yield a middleware that would incorrectly allow untrusted origin `https://barfoo.com`.\n\n### Patches\n\nPatched in v0.1.3.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNone.",
