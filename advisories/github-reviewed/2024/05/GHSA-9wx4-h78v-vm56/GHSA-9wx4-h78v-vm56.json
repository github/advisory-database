  "summary": "Requests `Session` object does not verify requests after making first request with verify=False",
  "details": "When making requests through a Requests `Session`, if the first request is made with `verify=False` to disable cert verification, all subsequent requests to the same origin will continue to ignore cert verification regardless of changes to the value of `verify`. This behavior will continue for the lifecycle of the connection in the connection pool.\n\n### Remediation\nAny of these options can be used to remediate the current issue, we highly recommend upgrading as the preferred mitigation.\n\n* Upgrade to `requests>=2.32.0`.\n* For `requests<2.32.0`, avoid setting `verify=False` for the first request to a host while using a Requests Session.\n* For `requests<2.32.0`, call `close()` on `Session` objects to clear existing connections if `verify=False` is used.\n\n### Related Links\n* https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/6655",
