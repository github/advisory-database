  "summary": "OMERO.web must check that the JSONP callback is a valid function",
  "details": "### Background\n\nThere is currently no escaping or validation of the `callback` parameter that can be passed to various OMERO.web endpoints that have JSONP enabled. One such endpoint is `/webclient/imgData/...`. As we only really use these endpoints with jQuery's own callback name generation [^1] it is quite difficult or even impossible to exploit this in vanilla OMERO.web. However, these metadata endpoints are likely to be used by many plugins.\n\n[^1]: https://learn.jquery.com/ajax/working-with-jsonp/\n\n### Impact\nOMERO.web before 5.25.0\n\n### Patches\nUsers should upgrade to 5.26.0 or higher\n### Workarounds\n\nNone\n\n### References\n* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2777021/do-i-need-to-sanitize-the-callback-parameter-from-a-jsonp-call\n* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1661197/what-characters-are-valid-for-javascript-variable-names\n\nFor more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\nOpen an issue in [omero-web](https://github.com/ome/omero-web)\nEmail us at [security@openmicroscopy.org](mailto:security@openmicroscopy.org)\n",
