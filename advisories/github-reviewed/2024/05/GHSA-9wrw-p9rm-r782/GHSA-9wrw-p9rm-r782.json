  "summary": "onelogin/php-saml Improper signature validation on LogoutRequest/LogoutResponse.",
  "details": "In order to verify Signatures on Logoutrequests and LogoutResponses we use\nthe verifySignature of the class XMLSecurityKey from the xmlseclibs library.\nThat method end up calling openssl_verify() depending on the signature algorithm used.\n\nThe openssl_verify() function returns 1 when the signature was successfully verified,\n0 if it failed to verify with the given key, and -1 in case an error occurs.\nPHP allows translating numerical values to boolean implicitly, with the following correspondences:\n- 0 equals false.\n- Non-zero equals true.\n\nThis means that an implicit conversion to boolean of the values returned by openssl_verify()\nwill convert an error state, signaled by the value -1, to a successful verification of the\nsignature (represented by the boolean true).\n\nThe LogoutRequest/LogoutResponse signature validator was performing an implicit conversion to boolean\nof the values returned by the verify() method, which subsequently will return the same output\nas openssl_verify() under most circumstances.\nThis means an error during signature verification is treated as a successful verification by the method.\n\nSince the signature validation of SAMLResponses were not affected, the impact of this security\nvulnerability is lower, but an update of the php-saml toolkit is recommended.",
