  "summary": "Vyper's `extract32` can ready dirty memory",
  "details": "### Summary\n\nWhen using the built-in `extract32(b, start)`, if the `start` index provided has for side effect to update `b`, the byte array to extract `32` bytes from, it could be that some dirty memory is read and returned by `extract32`.\n\n### Details\n\nBefore evaluating `start`, the function `Extract32.build_IR` caches only:\n\n- The pointer in memory/storage to `b`: https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/blob/10564dcc37756f3d3684b7a91fd8f4325a38c4d8/vyper/builtins/functions.py#L916-L918\n- The length of `b`: https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/blob/10564dcc37756f3d3684b7a91fd8f4325a38c4d8/vyper/builtins/functions.py#L920-L922\n\nbut do not cache the actual content of `b`. This means that if the evaluation of `start` changes `b`'s content and length, an outdated length will be used with the new content when extracting 32 bytes from `b`.\n\n### PoC\n\nCalling the function `foo` of the following contract returns `b'uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu\\x00\\x00789'` meaning that `extract32` accessed some dirty memory.\n\n```Vyper\nvar:Bytes[96]\n\n@internal\ndef bar() -> uint256:\n    self.var = b'uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu'\n    self.var = b''\n    return 3\n\n@external\ndef foo() -> bytes32:\n    self.var = b'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456789'\n    return extract32(self.var, self.bar(), output_type=bytes32)\n    # returns b'uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu\\x00\\x00789'\n```\n\n### Impact\n\nFor contracts that are affected, it means that calling `extract32` returns dirty memory bytes instead of some expected output.",
