  "summary": "Classic builder cache poisoning",
  "details": "The classic builder cache system is prone to cache poisoning if the image is built `FROM scratch`.\nAlso, changes to some instructions (most important being `HEALTHCHECK` and `ONBUILD`) would not cause a cache miss.\n\n\nAn attacker with the knowledge of the Dockerfile someone is using could poison their cache by making them pull a specially crafted image that would be considered as a valid cache candidate for some build steps.\n\nFor example, an attacker could create an image that is considered as a valid cache candidate for:\n```\nFROM scratch\nMAINTAINER Pawel\n```\n\nwhen in fact the malicious image used as a cache would be an image built from a different Dockerfile.\n\nIn the second case, the attacker could for example substitute a different `HEALTCHECK` command.\n\n\n### Impact\n\n23.0+ users are only affected if they explicitly opted out of Buildkit (`DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0` environment variable) or are using the `/build` API endpoint (which uses the classic builder by default).\n\nAll users on versions older than 23.0 could be impacted. An example could be a CI with a shared cache, or just a regular Docker user pulling a malicious image due to misspelling/typosquatting.\n\nImage build API endpoint (`/build`) and `ImageBuild` function from `github.com/docker/docker/client` is also affected as it the uses classic builder by default. \n\n\n### Patches\n\nPatches are included in Moby releases:\n\n- v25.0.2\n- v24.0.9\n- v23.0.10\n\n### Workarounds\n\n- Use `--no-cache` or use Buildkit if possible (`DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1`, it's default on 23.0+ assuming that the buildx plugin is installed).\n- Use `Version = types.BuilderBuildKit` or `NoCache = true` in `ImageBuildOptions` for `ImageBuild` call.\n\n",
