  "details": "### Impact\nDue to default case-insensitive collation in MySQL or MariaDB databases, third-party authentication user IDs are not case-sensitive and could cause different IDs to match.\n\n### Patches\nThis issue has been addressed by https://github.com/python-social-auth/social-app-django/pull/566 and fix released in 5.4.1.\n\n### Workarounds\nAn immediate workaround would be to change collation of the affected field:\n\n```mysql\nALTER TABLE `social_auth_association` MODIFY `uid` varchar(255) COLLATE `utf8_bin`;\n```\n\n### References\nThis issue was discovered by folks at https://opencraft.com/.\n",
