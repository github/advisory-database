  "details": "## Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is a duplicate of GHSA-4685-2x5r-65pj. This link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n## Original Description\nIt was discovered that Pebble's read-file API and the associated pebble pull command, before v1.10.2, allowed unprivileged local users to read files with root-equivalent permissions when Pebble was running as root. Fixes are also available as backports to v1.1.1, v1.4.2, and v1.7.4.",
