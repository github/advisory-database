  "summary": "AMPHP Denial of Service via HTTP/2 CONTINUATION Frames",
  "details": "`amphp/http` will collect HTTP/2 `CONTINUATION` frames in an unbounded buffer and will not check the header size limit until it has received the `END_HEADERS` flag, resulting in an OOM crash. `amphp/http-client` and `amphp/http-server` are indirectly affected if they're used with an unpatched version of `amphp/http`. Early versions of `amphp/http-client` with HTTP/2 support (v4.0.0-rc10 to 4.0.0) are also directly affected.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThank you to [Bartek Nowotarski](https://nowotarski.info/) for reporting the vulnerability.",
