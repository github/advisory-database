  "details": "### Summary\nThis is basically [GHSA-88j4-pcx8-q4q](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/security/advisories/GHSA-88j4-pcx8-q4q3) but instead of changing passwords, when enabling authentication.\n\n### PoC\n- Open Uptime Kuma with authentication disabled\n- Enable authentication using another window\n- Access the platform using the previously logged-in window\n- Note that access (read-write) remains despite the enabled authentication\n- Expected behaviour:\n  - After enabling authentication, all previously connected sessions should be invalidated, requiring users to log in.\n- Actual behaviour:\n  - The system retains sessions and never logs out users unless explicitly done by clicking logout or refreshing the page.\n\n### Impact\nSee [GHSA-g9v2-wqcj-j99g](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/security/advisories/GHSA-g9v2-wqcj-j99g) and [GHSA-88j4-pcx8-q4q](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/security/advisories/GHSA-88j4-pcx8-q4q3)\n\nTBH this is quite a niche edge case, so I don't know if this even warrants a security report.  \n",
