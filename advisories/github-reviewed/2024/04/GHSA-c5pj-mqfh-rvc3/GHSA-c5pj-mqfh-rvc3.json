  "summary": "cri-o allows an arbitrary systemd property to be injected",
  "details": "A flaw was found in cri-o, where an arbitrary systemd property can be injected via a Pod annotation. Any user who can create a pod with an arbitrary annotation may perform an arbitrary action on the host system. \n\nThis issue was once misidentified as a vulnerability of runc (< 1.2.0-rc.1), but actually this is the matter of how cri-o generates and validates the config for runc.\nrunc is designed to accept an arbitrary systemd property specified in the config, and will continue to do so in >= 1.2.0-rc.1.\nUsers do NOT need to update runc.",
