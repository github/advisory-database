  "summary": "Sentry SDK Prototype Pollution gadget in JavaScript SDKs",
  "details": "### Impact\nIn case a Prototype Pollution vulnerability is present in a user's application or bundled libraries, the Sentry SDK could potentially serve as a gadget to exploit that vulnerability. The exploitability depends on the specific details of the underlying Prototype Pollution issue.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> This advisory does not indicate the presence of a Prototype Pollution within the Sentry SDK itself. Users are strongly advised to first address any Prototype Pollution vulnerabilities in their application, as they pose a more critical security risk.\n\n### Patches\nThe issue was patched in all Sentry JavaScript SDKs starting from the [8.33.0](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/releases/tag/8.33.0) version.\nAlso, the fix was backported to SDK v7 in [7.119.1](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/releases/tag/7.119.1).\n\n### References\n* [Prototype Pollution](https://portswigger.net/web-security/prototype-pollution)\n* [Prototype Pollution gadgets](https://portswigger.net/web-security/prototype-pollution#prototype-pollution-gadgets)\n* [sentry-javascript#13838](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/13838)",
