If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n* If you have .NET 6.0 or greater installed, you can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\n\n\n Version:   8.0.200\n Commit:    8473146e7d\n\nRuntime Environment:\n\n OS Name:     Windows\n OS Version:  10.0.18363\n OS Platform: Windows\n RID:         win10-x64\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\6.0.300\\\n\nHost (useful for support):\n\n  Version: 8.0.3\n  Commit:  8473146e7d\n\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\n\n  8.0.200 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\n\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\n\n  Microsoft.AspAspNetCore.App 8.0.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspAspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 8.0.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 8.0.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\n\n\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0.8  Runtime or .NET 8.0.108 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.8) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\n\n.NET 8.0 updates are also available from Microsoft Update. To access this either type \"Check for updates\" in your Windows search, or open Settings, choose Update & Security and then click Check for Updates.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0  or .NET 6.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com. Reports may qualify for the Microsoft .NET Core & .NET 5 Bounty.
