  "summary": "Boa has an uncaught exception when transitioning the state of `AsyncGenerator` objects",
  "details": "A wrong assumption made when handling ECMAScript's `AsyncGenerator` operations can cause an uncaught exception on certain scripts.\n\n## Details\n\nBoa's implementation of `AsyncGenerator` makes the assumption that the state of an `AsyncGenerator` object cannot change while resolving a promise created by methods of `AsyncGenerator` such as `%AsyncGeneratorPrototype%.next`, `%AsyncGeneratorPrototype%.return`, or `%AsyncGeneratorPrototype%.throw`.\nHowever, a carefully constructed code could trigger a state transition from a getter method for the promise's `then` property, which causes the engine to fail an assertion of this assumption, causing an uncaught exception. This could be used to create a Denial Of Service attack in applications that run arbitrary ECMAScript code provided by an external user.\n\n## Patches\n\nVersion 0.19.0 is patched to correctly handle this case.\n\n## Workarounds\n\nUsers unable to upgrade to the patched version would want to use [`std::panic::catch_unwind`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/panic/fn.catch_unwind.html) to ensure any exceptions caused by the engine don't impact the availability of the main application.\n\n## References\n\n- https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/commit/69ea2f52ed976934bff588d6b566bae01be313f7\n- https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/security/advisories/GHSA-g38c-wh3c-5h9r",
