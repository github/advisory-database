  ],
  "summary": "fish-shop/syntax-check Improper Neutralization of Delimiters",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nImproper neutralisation of delimiters in the `pattern` input (specifically the command separator `;` and command substitution characters `(` and `)`) mean that arbitrary command injection is possible by modification of the input value used in a workflow. This has the potential for exposure or exfiltration of sensitive information from the workflow runner, such as might be achieved by sending environment variables to an external entity.\n\n### Patches\n\nAs of this writing, the issue has been patched for versions in the `v1.x.x` release series in release `v1.6.12` (also tagged as `v1.6` and `v1`). The latest available release `v2.0.0` also includes a corresponding patch (also tagged as `v2.0` and `v2`).\n\nUsers should upgrade to at least the patched version `v1.6.12` or preferably the latest available version `v2.0.0`. Workflows that use the action ref `v1` will automatically receive the patched version `v1.6.12` in future workflow runs.\n\nPatch summary:\n\n| Release series | Patched tags    | Patched commit hashes |\n|----------------|-------------------------|-------------|\n| `1.x.x`        | `v1.6.12`, `v1.6`, `v1` | `91e6817c48ad475542fe4e78139029b036a53b03`    |\n| `2.x.x`        | `v2.0.0`, `v2.0`, `v2`  | `c2cb11395e21119ff8d6e7ea050430ee7d6f49ca`    |\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIs it recommended that users update to the patched version `v1.6.12` or the latest release version `v2.0.0`, however remediation may be possible through careful control of workflows and the `pattern` input value used by this action.\n\n### References\n\n- [CWE-140: Improper Neutralization of Delimiters](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/140.html)\n- [CAPEC-15: Command Delimiters](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/15.html)\n",
