  "summary": "Pimcore Customer Data Framework Improper Access Control allows unprivileged user to access GDPR extracts",
  "details": "### Summary\nAn authenticated and unauthorized user can access the GDPR data extraction feature and query over the information returned, leading to customer data exposure.\n\n### Details\nPermissions do not seem to be enforced when reaching the `/admin/customermanagementframework/gdpr-data/search-data-objects` endpoint allowing an authenticated user without the permissions to access the endpoint and query the data available there. It seems that the access control is not enforced in this place : <https://github.com/pimcore/customer-data-framework/blob/b4af625ef327c58d05ef7cdf145fa749d2d4195e/src/Controller/Admin/GDPRDataController.php#L38>\n\n### PoC\n\nIn order to reproduce the issue, the following steps can be followed: \n\n1. As an administrator : \n  a. Create a role without any permission through Settings → User & Roles → Roles in the administration panel\n  b. Create an user through Settings → User & Roles → Users and assign it the unprivileged role previously created\n2. Log out the current administrator and log in with this new user\n3. Access to the following endpoint `https://pimcore_instance/admin/customermanagementframework/gdpr-data/search-data-objects?id=&firstname=&lastname=&email=&page=1&start=0&limit=50` and the results will be returned to this unauthorized user.\n\n### Impact\nAn unauthorized user can access PII data from customers without being authorized to. \n",
