  "summary": "tj-actions/changed-files has Potential Actions command injection in output filenames (GHSL-2023-271)",
  "details": "### Summary\nThe `tj-actions/changed-files` workflow allows for command injection in changed filenames, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code and potentially leak secrets.\n\n### Details\nThe [`changed-files`](https://github.com/tj-actions/changed-files) action returns a list of files changed in a commit or pull request which provides an `escape_json` input [enabled by default](https://github.com/tj-actions/changed-files/blob/94549999469dbfa032becf298d95c87a14c34394/action.yml#L136), only escapes `\"` for JSON values. \n\nThis could potentially allow filenames that contain special characters such as `;` and \\` (backtick) which can be used by an attacker to take over the [GitHub Runner](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners) if the output value is used in a raw fashion (thus being directly replaced before execution) inside a `run` block. By running custom commands an attacker may be able to steal **secrets** such as `GITHUB_TOKEN` if triggered on other events than `pull_request`. For example on `push`.\n\n#### Proof of Concept\n\n1. Submit a pull request to a repository with a new file injecting a command. For example `$(whoami).txt` which is a valid filename.\n2. Upon approval of the workflow (triggered by the pull request), the action will get executed and the malicious pull request filename will flow into the `List all changed files` step below.\n\n```yaml\n      - name: List all changed files\n        run: |\n          for file in ${{ steps.changed-files.outputs.all_changed_files }}; do\n            echo \"$file was changed\"\n          done\n```\n\nExample output:\n\n```yaml\n##[group]Run for file in $(whoami).txt; do\n    for file in $(whoami).txt; do\n        echo \"$file was changed\"\n    done\nshell: /usr/bin/bash -e {0}\n##[endgroup]\nrunner.txt was changed\n```\n\n### Impact\n\nThis issue may lead to arbitrary command execution in the GitHub Runner.\n\n### Resolution\n- A new `safe_output` input would be enabled by default and return filename paths escaping special characters like ;, ` (backtick), $, (), etc for bash environments.\n\n- A safe recommendation of using environment variables to store unsafe outputs.\n\n```yaml\n- name: List all changed files\n  env:\n    ALL_CHANGED_FILES: ${{ steps.changed-files.outputs.all_changed_files }}\n  run: |\n    for file in \"$ALL_CHANGED_FILES\"; do\n      echo \"$file was changed\"\n    done\n```\n\n### Resources\n\n* [Keeping your GitHub Actions and workflows secure Part 2: Untrusted input](https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-untrusted-input/)\n* [Keeping your GitHub Actions and workflows secure Part 1: Preventing pwn requests](https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests/)",
