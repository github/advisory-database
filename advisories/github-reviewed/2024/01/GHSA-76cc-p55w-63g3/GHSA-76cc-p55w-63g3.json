  "details": "## Withdrawn Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because the vulnerability affects a binary, not a library in a [supported ecosystem](https://github.com/github/advisory-database#supported-ecosystems). Therefore, users of the library should not receive alerts. This link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n## Original Description\n\n### Impact\nAccess Lists are a new feature introduced in Teleport 14 and currently under preview. An issue was discovered that allows an Access List Owner to assign arbitrary permissions, including permissions to themselves which could result in privilege escalation.\n\n### Patches\nFixed in version 14.2.4 and 13.4.13",
