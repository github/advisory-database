  "details": "### Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is a duplicate of GHSA-5crp-9r3c-p9vr. This link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n### Original Description\nNewtonsoft.Json before version 13.0.1 is affected by a mishandling of exceptional conditions vulnerability. Crafted data that is passed to the JsonConvert.DeserializeObject method may trigger a StackOverflow exception resulting in denial of service. Depending on the usage of the library, an unauthenticated and remote attacker may be able to cause the denial of service condition.\n",
