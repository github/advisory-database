  "summary": "Filament has unvalidated ColorColumn and ColorEntry values that can be used for Cross-site Scripting",
  "details": "### Summary\n\nIf values passed to a `ColorColumn` or `ColumnEntry` are not valid and contain a specific set of characters, applications are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attack against a user who opens a page on which a color column or entry is rendered.\n\nVersions of Filament from v3.0.0 through v3.2.114 are affected.\n\nPlease upgrade to Filament [v3.2.115](https://github.com/filamentphp/filament/releases/tag/v3.2.115).\n\n### PoC\n\n> *PoC will be published in a few weeks, once developers have had a chance to upgrade their apps.*\n\n### Response\n\nThis vulnerability (in `ColorColumn` only) was reported by @sv-LayZ, who reported the issue and patched the issue during the evening of 25/09/2024. Thank you Mattis.\n\nThe review process concluded on 27/09/2024, which revealed the issue was also present in `ColorEntry`. This was fixed the same day and Filament [v3.2.115](https://github.com/filamentphp/filament/releases/tag/v3.2.115) followed.\n\n> *An explanation of the fix will be published in a few weeks, once developers have had a chance to upgrade their apps.*\n\nAlthough these components are no longer vulnerable to this type of XSS attack, it is good practice to validate colors, and since many Filament users may be accepting color input using the `ColorPicker` form component, [additional color validation documentation was published](https://filamentphp.com/docs/3.x/forms/fields/color-picker#color-picker-validation).",
