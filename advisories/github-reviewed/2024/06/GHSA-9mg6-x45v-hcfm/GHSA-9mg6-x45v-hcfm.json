  "summary": "activeadmin vulnerable to stored persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) in dynamic form legends",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nUsers settings their active admin form legends dynamically may be vulnerable to stored XSS, as long as its value can be injected directly by a malicious user.\n\nFor example:\n\n* A public web application allows users to create entities with arbitrary names.\n* Active Admin is used to administrate these entities through a private backend.\n* The form to edit these entities in the private backend has the following shape (note the dynamic `name` value dependent on an attribute of the `resource`):\n\n```ruby\n  form do |f|\n    f.inputs name: resource.name do\n      f.input :name\n      f.input :description\n    end\n\n    f.actions\n  end\n```\n\nThen a malicious user could create an entity with a payload that would get executed in the active admin administrator's browser.\n\nBoth `form` blocks with an implicit or explicit name (i.e., both `form resource.name` or `form name: resource.name` would suffer from the problem), where the value of the name can be arbitrarily set by non admin users.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe problem has been fixed in ActiveAdmin 3.2.2 and ActiveAdmin 4.0.0.beta7.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUsers can workaround this problem without upgrading by explicitly escaping the form name using an HTML escaping utility. For example:\n\n```ruby\n  form do |f|\n    f.inputs name: ERB::Util.html_escape(resource.name) do\n      f.input :name\n      f.input :description\n    end\n\n    f.actions\n  end\n```\nUpgrading is of course recommended though.\n\n### References\nhttps://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/#stored-xss-attacks",
