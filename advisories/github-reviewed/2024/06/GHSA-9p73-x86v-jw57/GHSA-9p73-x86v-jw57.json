  "summary": "path traversal vulnerability was identified in the parisneo/lollms-webui ",
  "details": "A path traversal vulnerability was identified in the parisneo/lollms-webui repository, specifically within version 9.6. The vulnerability arises due to improper handling of user-supplied input in the 'list_personalities' endpoint. By crafting a malicious HTTP request, an attacker can traverse the directory structure and view the contents of any folder, albeit limited to subfolder names only. This issue was demonstrated via a specific HTTP request that manipulated the 'category' parameter to access arbitrary directories. The vulnerability is present in the code located at the 'endpoints/lollms_advanced.py' file.",
