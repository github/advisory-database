  "summary": "Zendframework1 Potential SQL injection in ORDER and GROUP functions",
  "details": "The implementation of ORDER BY and GROUP BY in Zend_Db_Select remained prone to SQL injection when a combination of SQL expressions and comments were used. This security patch provides a comprehensive solution that identifies and removes comments prior to checking validity of the statement to ensure no SQLi vectors occur.\n\nThe implementation of ORDER BY and GROUP BY in Zend_Db_Select of ZF1 is vulnerable by the following SQL injection:\n```\n$db = Zend_Db::factory(/* options here */);\n$select = new Zend_Db_Select($db);\n$select->from('p');\n$select->order(\"MD5(\\\"a(\\\");DELETE FROM p2; #)\"); // same with group()\n```\nThe above $select will render the following SQL statement:\n```\nSELECT `p`.* FROM `p` ORDER BY MD5(\"a(\");DELETE FROM p2; #) ASC\n```\ninstead of the correct one:\n```\nSELECT \"p\".* FROM \"p\" ORDER BY \"MD5(\"\"a(\"\");DELETE FROM p2; #)\" ASC\n```\nThis security fix can be considered an improvement of the previous ZF2016-02 and ZF2014-04 advisories.\n\nAs a final consideration, we recommend developers either never use user input for these operations, or filter user input thoroughly prior to invoking Zend_Db. You can use the Zend_Db_Select::quoteInto() method to filter the input data, as shown in this example:\n```\n$db    = Zend_Db::factory(...);\n$input = \"MD5(\\\"a(\\\");DELETE FROM p2; #)\"; // user input can be an attack\n$order = $db->quoteInto(\"SQL statement for ORDER\", $input);\n\n$select = new Zend_Db_Select($db);\n$select->from('p');\n$select->order($order); // same with group()\n```",
