  "details": "### Summary\nVulnerability scan of fiona shows [CVE-2023-45853](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45853). The vulnerability is in GDAL, a dependency of fiona.\n\n### Details\nFiona depends on GDAL and GDAL has a port of minizip. MiniZip in zlib through 1.3 has an integer overflow and resultant heap-based buffer overflow in zipOpenNewFileInZip4_64 via a long filename, comment, or extra field. The GDAL project has addressed the CVE in version 3.8.0. See https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/gdal-dev/2023-November/057881.html.\n\nThe Fiona version 1.9.6 wheels on PyPI include GDAL version 3.6.4 and thus could be vulnerable. All of the Fiona 1.10 pre-release wheels in PyPI include GDAL version 3.8.4 and are not vulnerable.\n\n### Impact\nSystems which use GDAL versions prior to 3.8.0 to open unchecked zip files, whether in combination with fiona or not, could be susceptible to buffer overflows.",
