  "summary": "TorchServe gRPC Port Exposure",
  "details": "### Impact\nThe two gRPC ports 7070 and 7071, are not bound to [localhost](http://localhost/) by default, so when TorchServe is launched, these two interfaces are bound to all interfaces. Customers using PyTorch inference Deep Learning Containers (DLC) through Amazon SageMaker and EKS are not affected.\n\n### Patches\nThis issue in TorchServe has been fixed in [#3083](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/pull/3083).\n\nTorchServe release 0.11.0 includes the fix to address this vulnerability.\n\n### References\n* [#3083](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/pull/3083)\n* [TorchServe release v0.11.0](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/releases/tag/v0.11.0)\n\nThank Kroll Cyber Risk for for responsibly disclosing this issue.\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, we ask that you contact AWS Security via our [vulnerability reporting page](https://aws.amazon.com/security/vulnerability-reporting) or directly via email to [aws-security@amazon.com](mailto:aws-security@amazon.com).
