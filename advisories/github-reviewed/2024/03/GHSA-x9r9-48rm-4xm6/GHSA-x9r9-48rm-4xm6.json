  "summary": "FitNesse allows execution of arbitrary OS commands",
  "details": "FitNesse all releases allows a remote authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands.\n\n\nAs expressed in FitNesse repository's security.md, FitNesse is a development and testing tool, aimed at automating acceptance testing activities and is therefore, _designed_ to execute commands on systems (host or others). Fixing this CVE would mean no less than to remove the main functionality of FitNesse.\n\nAs stated in the respository's security.md:\n\n-----\nFitNesse is intended to be used as part of a software development tool set. It allows a user to compose web pages containing any Javascript code, and to run acceptance tests which may include the execution of any runnable code. Therefore we recommend the following:\n\n- FitNesse should be run in a secure sandboxed development environment.\n- FitNesse should be available only to trusted, knowledgeable, and professional members of the development team.\n- FitNesse should not be exposed on any public-facing servers.\n- FitNesse should not have access to any production environments. If testing with production data is desired, a copy of the data should be made to a secure sandboxed test environment.\n- When running FitNesse on a local machine, the -lh command line argument will ensure only connections from the same machine are accepted.",
