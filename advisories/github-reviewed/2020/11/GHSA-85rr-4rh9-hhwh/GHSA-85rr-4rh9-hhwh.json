  "summary": "Memory leak in Nanopb",
  "details": "### Impact\nDecoding specifically formed message can leak memory if dynamic allocation is enabled and an oneof field contains a static submessage that contains a dynamic field, and the message being decoded contains the submessage multiple times. This is rare in normal messages, but it is a concern when untrusted data is parsed.\n\n### Patches\nPreliminary patch is [available on git](https://github.com/nanopb/nanopb/commit/edf6dcbffee4d614ac0c2c1b258ab95185bdb6e9) and problem will be patched in versions 0.3.9.7 and 0.4.4 once testing has been completed.\n\n### Workarounds\nFollowing workarounds are available:\n* Set the option `no_unions` for the oneof field. This will generate fields as separate instead of C union, and avoids triggering the problematic code.\n* Set the type of the submessage field inside oneof to `FT_POINTER`. This way the whole submessage will be dynamically allocated and the problematic code is not executed.\n* Use an arena allocator for nanopb, to make sure all memory can be released afterwards.\n\n### References\nBug report: https://github.com/nanopb/nanopb/issues/615\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, comment on the bug report linked above.",
