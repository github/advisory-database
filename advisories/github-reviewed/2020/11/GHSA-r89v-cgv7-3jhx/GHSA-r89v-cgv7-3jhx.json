  "summary": "Bypass of fix for CVE-2020-15247, Twig sandbox escape",
  "details": "### Impact\nA bypass of CVE-2020-15247 (fixed in 1.0.469 and 1.1.0) was discovered that has the same impact as CVE-2020-15247:\n\nAn authenticated backend user with the `cms.manage_pages`, `cms.manage_layouts`, or `cms.manage_partials` permissions who would **normally** not be permitted to provide PHP code to be executed by the CMS due to `cms.enableSafeMode` being enabled is able to write specific Twig code to escape the Twig sandbox and execute arbitrary PHP.\n\nThis is not a problem for anyone that trusts their users with those permissions to normally write & manage PHP within the CMS by not having `cms.enableSafeMode` enabled, but would be a problem for anyone relying on `cms.enableSafeMode` to ensure that users with those permissions in production do not have access to write & execute arbitrary PHP.\n\n### Patches\nIssue has been patched in Build 470 (v1.0.470) and v1.1.1.\n\n### Workarounds\nApply https://github.com/octobercms/october/commit/d34fb8ab51108495a9a651b841202d935f4e12f7 to your installation manually if unable to upgrade to Build 470 or v1.1.1.\n\n### References\nReported by [ka1n4t](https://github.com/ka1n4t)\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Email us at [hello@octobercms.com](mailto:hello@octobercms.com)\n\n### Threat assessment:\n<img width=\"1108\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-10-10 at 1 21 13 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7253840/95663316-7de28b80-0afb-11eb-999d-a6526cf78709.png\">",
