  "summary": "Open redirect in Jupyter Server",
  "details": "### Impact\n_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\n\nOpen redirect vulnerability - a maliciously crafted link to a jupyter server could redirect the browser to a different website.\n\nAll jupyter servers are technically affected, however, these maliciously crafted links can only be reasonably made for known jupyter server hosts. A link to your jupyter server may *appear* safe, but ultimately redirect to a spoofed server on the public internet.\n\nThis originated in jupyter/notebook: https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/security/advisories/GHSA-c7vm-f5p4-8fqh\n\n### Patches\n\n_Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_\n\njupyter_server 1.0.6\n\n### References\n\n[OWASP page on open redirects](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, or vulnerabilities to report, please email our security list [security@ipython.org](mailto:security@ipython.org).\n\nCredit: zhuonan li of Alibaba Application Security Team",
