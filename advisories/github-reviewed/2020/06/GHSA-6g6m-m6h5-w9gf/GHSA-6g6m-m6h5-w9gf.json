  "summary": "Authorization bypass in express-jwt",
  "details": "### Overview\nVersions before and including 5.3.3, we are not enforcing the **algorithms** entry to be specified in the configuration.\nWhen **algorithms** is not specified in the configuration, with the combination of jwks-rsa, it may lead to authorization bypass. \n\n### Am I affected?\nYou are affected by this vulnerability if all of the following conditions apply:\n\nYou are using express-jwt\nAND \nYou do not have **algorithms**  configured in your express-jwt configuration.\nAND\nYou are using libraries such as jwks-rsa as the **secret**. \n\n### How to fix that?\nSpecify **algorithms** in the express-jwt configuration. The following is an example of a proper configuration\n\n``` \nconst checkJwt = jwt({\n  secret: jwksRsa.expressJwtSecret({\n    rateLimit: true,\n    jwksRequestsPerMinute: 5,\n    jwksUri: `https://${DOMAIN}/.well-known/jwks.json`\n  }),\n  // Validate the audience and the issuer.\n  audience: process.env.AUDIENCE,\n  issuer: `https://${DOMAIN}/`,\n  // restrict allowed algorithms\n  algorithms: ['RS256']\n}); \n```\n\n### Will this update impact my users?\nThe fix provided in patch will not affect your users if you specified the algorithms allowed. The patch now makes **algorithms** a required configuration. \n\n\n### Credit\nIST Group",
