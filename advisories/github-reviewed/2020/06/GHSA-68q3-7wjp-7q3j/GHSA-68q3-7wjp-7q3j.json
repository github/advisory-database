  "summary": "The filename of uploaded files vulnerable to stored XSS",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nThe filename of uploaded files was vulnerable to stored XSS. It is not possible to inject javascript code in the file name when creating/uploading the file. But, once created/uploaded, it can be renamed to inject the payload in it. \n\nAdditionally, the measures to prevent renaming the file to disallowed filename extensions could be circumvented.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis is fixed in Bolt 3.7.1.\n\n### References\n\nRelated issue: https://github.com/bolt/bolt/pull/7853",
