  ],
  "summary": "Privilege escalation in Presto",
  "details": "### Affected\nThis affects Presto server installations. This does NOT affect clients such as the CLI or JDBC driver.\n\n### Impact\nAuthenticated users can bypass authorization checks by directly accessing internal APIs. This impacts Presto server installations with secure internal communication configured.\n\nThis does not affect installations that have not configured secure internal communication, as these installations are inherently insecure.\n\n### Patches\nThis issue has been fixed starting with PrestoSQL version 337.\n\n### Workarounds\nThis issue can be mitigated by blocking network access to internal APIs on the coordinator and workers. \n\n### References\nSee the Presto documentation for [Secure Internal Communication](https://trino.io/docs/current/security/internal-communication.html).\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Join the **#security** channel on [Slack](https://trino.io/slack.html).\n* Contact the security team at [security@trino.io](mailto:security@trino.io)",
