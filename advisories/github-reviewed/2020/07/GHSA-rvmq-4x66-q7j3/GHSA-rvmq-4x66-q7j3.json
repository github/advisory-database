  "summary": "Remote code execution (RCE) in Apache Airflow",
  "details": "An issue was found in Apache Airflow versions 1.10.10 and below. A remote code/command injection vulnerability was discovered in one of the example DAGs shipped with Airflow which would allow any authenticated user to run arbitrary commands as the user running airflow worker/scheduler (depending on the executor in use). If you already have examples disabled by setting `load_examples=False` in the config then you are not vulnerable.",
