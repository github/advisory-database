  "summary": "Unauthorized privilege escalation in Mod module",
  "details": "### Impact\nAn unauthorized privilege escalation exploit has been discovered in the Mod module: this exploit allows Discord users with a high privilege level within the guild to bypass hierarchy checks when the application is in a specific condition that is beyond that user's control. By abusing this exploit, it's possible to perform destructive actions within the guild the user has high privileges in.\n\n### Patches\nThis exploit has been fixed on version & ``3.4.1``.\n\n### Workarounds\nUnloading the Mod module with ``unload mod`` __or__, disabling the ``massban`` command with ``command disable global massban`` can render this exploit not accessible. We still highly recommend updating to ``3.4.1`` to completely patch this issue.\n\n### References\n* https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot/commit/726bfd38adfdfaef760412a68e01447b470f438b\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot)\n* Over on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/red)",
