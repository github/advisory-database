  "summary": "Sensitive data exposure in NATS",
  "details": "Preview versions of two NPM packages and one Deno package from the NATS\nproject contain an information disclosure flaw, leaking options to the\nNATS server; for one package, this includes TLS private credentials.\n\nThe _connection_ configuration options in these JavaScript-based\nimplementations were fully serialized and sent to the server in the\nclient's CONNECT message, immediately after TLS establishment.\n\nThe nats.js client supports Mutual TLS and the credentials for the TLS\nclient key are included in the connection configuration options;\ndisclosure of the client's TLS private key to the server has been\nobserved.\n\nMost authentication mechanisms are handled after connection, instead of\nas part of connection, so other authentication mechanisms are\nunaffected.\nFor clarity: NATS account NKey authentication is NOT affected.\n\nNeither the nats.ws nor the nats.deno clients support Mutual TLS: the\naffected versions listed below are those where the logic flaw is\npresent. We are including the nats.ws and nats.deno versions out of an\nabundance of caution, as library maintainers, but rate as minimal the\nlikelihood of applications leaking sensitive data.\n\nAffected versions:\n\nSecurity impact:\n\n* NPM package nats.js:\n+ mainline is unaffected\n+ beta branch is vulnerable from 2.0.0-201, fixed in 2.0.0-209\n\nLogic flaw:\n\n* NPM package nats.ws:\n+ status: preview\n+ flawed from 1.0.0-85, fixed in 1.0.0-111\n* Deno repository https://github.com/nats-io/nats.deno\n+ status: preview\n+ flawed in all git tags prior to fix\n+ fixed with git tag v1.0.0-9\n\nImpact:\n\nFor deployments using TLS client certificates (for mutual TLS), private\nkey material for TLS is leaked from the client application to the\nserver. If the server is untrusted (run by a third party), or if the\nclient application also disables TLS verification (and so the true\nidentity of the server is unverifiable) then authentication credentials\nare leaked.",
