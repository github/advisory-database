  "summary": "Insecure serialization leading to RCE in serialize-javascript",
  "details": "serialize-javascript prior to 3.1.0 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary code via the function \"deleteFunctions\" within \"index.js\". \n\nAn object such as `{\"foo\": /1\"/, \"bar\": \"a\\\"@__R-<UID>-0__@\"}` was serialized as `{\"foo\": /1\"/, \"bar\": \"a\\/1\"/}`, which allows an attacker to escape the `bar` key. This requires the attacker to control the values of both `foo` and `bar` and guess the value of `<UID>`. The UID has a keyspace of approximately 4 billion making it a realistic network attack.",
