  "summary": "CSRF in Field Test",
  "details": "The Field Test dashboard is vulnerable to cross-site request forgery (CSRF) with non-session based authentication methods in versions v0.2.0 through v0.3.2.\n\n## Impact\nThe Field Test dashboard is vulnerable to CSRF with non-session based authentication methods, like basic authentication. Session-based authentication methods (like Devise's default authentication) are not affected.\n\nA CSRF attack works by getting an authorized user to visit a malicious website and then performing requests on behalf of the user. In this instance, a single endpoint is affected, which allows for changing the variant assigned to a user.\n\nAll users running an affected release should upgrade immediately.\n\n## Technical Details\nField Test uses the `protect_from_forgery` method from Rails to prevent CSRF. However, this defaults to `:null_session`, which has no effect on non-session based authentication methods. This has been changed to `protect_from_forgery with: :exception`.",
