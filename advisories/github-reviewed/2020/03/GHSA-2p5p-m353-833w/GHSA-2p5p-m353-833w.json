  "summary": "Sort order SQL injection in Administrate",
  "details": "In Administrate (rubygem) before version 0.13.0, when sorting by attributes on a dashboard,\nthe direction parameter was not validated before being interpolated into the SQL query.\nThis could present a SQL injection if the attacker were able to modify the `direction` parameter and bypass ActiveRecord SQL protections.\n\nWhilst this does have a high-impact, to exploit this you need access to the Administrate dashboards, which we would expect to be behind authentication.\n\nThis is patched in wersion 0.13.0.",
