  "summary": "Command Injection in treekill",
  "details": "All versions of `treekill` are vulnerable to Command Injection. The package fails to sanitize values passed to the  `kill` function. If this value is user-controlled it  may allow attackers to run arbitrary commands in the server. The issue only affects Windows systems.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative package until a fix is made available.",
