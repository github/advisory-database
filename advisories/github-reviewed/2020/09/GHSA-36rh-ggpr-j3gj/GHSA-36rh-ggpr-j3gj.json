  "summary": "Renovate vulnerable to Azure DevOps token leakage in logs",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nApplies to Azure DevOps users only. The bot's token may be exposed in server or pipeline logs due to the `http.extraheader=AUTHORIZATION` parameter being logged without redaction. It is recommended that Azure DevOps users revoke their existing bot credentials and generate new ones after upgrading if there's a potential that logs have been saved to a location that others can view.\n\n### Patches\n\nFixed in \n\n### Workarounds\n\nDo not share Renovate logs with anyone who cannot be trusted with access to the token.\n",
