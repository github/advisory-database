  "summary": "Cross-Site Scripting in bleach",
  "details": "All versions of `bleach` are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting. It is possible to bypass the package's HTML sanitization with payloads such as `\"<<script><</script>script>alert('xss');</<script><</script>script>\"` regardless of the passed options. This may allow attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative package until a fix is made available.",
