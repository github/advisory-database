  "summary": "Cross-Site Scripting in atlasboard-atlassian-package",
  "details": "All versions of `atlasboard-atlassian-package` prior to 0.4.2 are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).  The package fails to properly sanitize user input that is rendered as HTML, which may allow attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in a victim's browser. This requires attackers being able to change issue summaries in Jira tickets.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative package until a fix is made available.",
