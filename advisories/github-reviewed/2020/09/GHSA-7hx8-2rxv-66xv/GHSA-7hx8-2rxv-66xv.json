  "details": "All Versions of `hapi` are vulnerable to Denial of Service. The CORS request handler has a vulnerability which will cause the function to throw a system error if the header contains some invalid values. If no unhandled exception handler is available, the application will exist, allowing an attacker to shut down services.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nThis package is deprecated and is now maintained as `@hapi/hapi`. Please update your dependencies to use `@hapi/hapi`. ",
