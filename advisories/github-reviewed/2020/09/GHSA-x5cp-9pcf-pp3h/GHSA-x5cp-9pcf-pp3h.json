  ],
  "summary": "Denial of Service in Tensorflow",
  "details": "### Impact\nThe `RaggedCountSparseOutput` does not validate that the input arguments form a valid ragged tensor. In particular, there is no validation that the `splits` tensor has the minimum required number of elements. Code uses this quantity to initialize a different data structure:\nhttps://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/0e68f4d3295eb0281a517c3662f6698992b7b2cf/tensorflow/core/kernels/count_ops.cc#L241-L244\n\nSince `BatchedMap` is equivalent to a vector, it needs to have at least one element to not be `nullptr`. If user passes a `splits` tensor that is empty or has exactly one element, we get a `SIGABRT` signal raised by the operating system.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in 3cbb917b4714766030b28eba9fb41bb97ce9ee02 and will release a patch release.\n\nWe recommend users to upgrade to TensorFlow 2.3.1.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability is a variant of [GHSA-p5f8-gfw5-33w4](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-p5f8-gfw5-33w4)",
