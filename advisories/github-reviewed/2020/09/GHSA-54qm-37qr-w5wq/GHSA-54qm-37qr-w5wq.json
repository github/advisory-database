  "summary": "Sandbox Breakout / Arbitrary Code Execution in veval",
  "details": "All versions of `veval` are vulnerable to Sandbox Escape leading to Remote Code Execution. The package fails to restrict access to the main context through `this.constructor.constructor` . This may allow attackers to execute arbitrary code in the system. Evaluating the payload `this.constructor.constructor('return process.env')()` prints the contents of `process.env`.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative package until a fix is made available.",
