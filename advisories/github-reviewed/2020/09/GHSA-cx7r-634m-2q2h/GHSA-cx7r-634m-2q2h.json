  "details": "# Withdrawn\n\nThis advisory has been withdrawn per request from the maintainer.  Given harp is a static webserver, a XSS type of vulnerability is not appropriate.\n\n### Original advisory description\n\nAll versions of `harp` are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting. Due to misconfiguration of its rendering engine, `harp` does not sanitize the HTML output allowing attackers to run arbitrary JavaScript when processing malicious files.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative module until a fix is made available.",
