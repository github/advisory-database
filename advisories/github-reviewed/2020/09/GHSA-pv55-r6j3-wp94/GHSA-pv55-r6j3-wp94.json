This code would read the users `.npmrc` file and send any found authentication tokens to a remote server.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nThe best course of action if you found this package installed in your environment is to revoke all your npm tokens. You can find instructions on how to do that here. https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/working_with_tokens#how-to-revoke-tokens\n",
