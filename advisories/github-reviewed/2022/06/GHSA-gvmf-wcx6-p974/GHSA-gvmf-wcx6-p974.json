  "summary": "Improper quoting of columns when using setOrderBy() or setGroupBy() on listing classes in Pimcore",
  "details": "### Impact\nPimcore offers developers listing classes to make querying data easier. This listing classes also allow to order or group the results based on one or more columns which should be quoted by default. \nThe actual issue is that quoting is not done properly in both cases, so there's the theoretical possibility to inject custom SQL if the developer is using this methods with input data and not doing proper input validation in advance and  so relies on the auto-quoting being done by the listing classes. \n\n##### Example: \n```php\n// request url: https://example.com/foo?groupBy=o_id`; SELECT SLEEP(20);--\n\n$list = new DataObject\\Car\\Listing();\n$list->setOrderKey($request->get('orderBy'));\n$list->setGroupBy($request->get('groupBy'));\n$list->load();\n```\n\n### Patches\nUpgrade to >= 10.4.4 or apply the following patch manually: \nhttps://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/commit/21559c6bf0e4e828d33ff7af6e88caecb5ac6549.patch\n\n### Workarounds\nApply this patch manually: \nhttps://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/commit/21559c6bf0e4e828d33ff7af6e88caecb5ac6549.patch\n\n### References\nhttps://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/pull/12444\n",
