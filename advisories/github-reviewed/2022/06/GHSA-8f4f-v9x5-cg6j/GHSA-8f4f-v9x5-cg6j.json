  "summary": "CloudCore UDS Server: Malicious Message can crash CloudCore",
  "details": "### Impact\nA malicious message can crash CloudCore by triggering a null-pointer dereference in the UDS Server. Since the UDS Server only communicates with the CSI Driver on the cloud side, the attack is limited to the local host network. As such, an attacker would already need to be an authenticated user of the Cloud.\n \nIt will be affected only when users turn on the unixsocket switch in the config file `cloudcore.yaml` as below:\n```\nmodules:\n  cloudHub:\n    ...\n    unixsocket:\n      address: xxx\n      enable: true\n```\n\n### Patches\nThis bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.0, 1.10.1, and 1.9.3. Users should update to these versions to resolve the issue.\n\n### Workarounds\nDisable the unixsocket switch of CloudHub in the config file `cloudcore.yaml`.\n\n### References\nNA\n\n### Credits\nThanks David Korczynski and Adam Korczynski of ADA Logics for responsibly disclosing this issue in accordance with the [kubeedge security policy](https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/security/policy) during a security audit sponsored by CNCF and facilitated by OSTIF.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [KubeEdge repo](https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/issues/new/choose)\n* To make a vulnerability report, email your vulnerability to the private [cncf-kubeedge-security@lists.cncf.io](mailto:cncf-kubeedge-security@lists.cncf.io) list with the security details and the details expected for [KubeEdge bug reports](https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug-report.md).\n\n**Notes:** This vulnerability was found by fuzzing KubeEdge by way of OSS-Fuzz.",
