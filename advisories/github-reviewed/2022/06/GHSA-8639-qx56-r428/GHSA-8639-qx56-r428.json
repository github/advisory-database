  "summary": "CSRF allows attacker to finalize/unfinalize order adjustments in solidus_backend",
  "details": "### Impact\nCSRF vulnerability allowing attackers to change the state of an order's adjustments if they hold its number, and the execution happens on a store administrator's computer.\n\nReproduction steps:\n- Take an order's number.\n- Log in as an administrator.\n- Visit that order's adjustments section (_Orders -> {Click on number} -> Adjustments_) and check that its adjustments are finalized (closed padlock under the **State** column).\n- On another tab, visit `{your_site_url}/admin/orders/{order_number}/adjustments/unfinalize`.\n- Notice how the adjustments are unfinalized (open padlock), even if the previous was a `GET` request which could have been linked from any other site.\n- Visit `{your_site_url}/admin/orders/{order_number}/adjustments/finalize`.\n- Notice how the adjustments are again finalized.\n\nThat happened because both routes were handled as `GET` requests, which are skipped by Rails anti-forgery protection.\n\n### Patches\nUsers should upgrade to solidus_backend v3.1.6, v3.0.6, or v2.11.16, depending on the major and minor versions in use.\n\n### References\n- [Rails CSRF protection](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/RequestForgeryProtection.html).\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n- Open an [issue](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/issues) or a [discussion](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/discussions) in Solidus.\n- Email us at [security@solidus.io](mailto:security@soliidus.io)\n- Contact the core team on [Slack](http://slack.solidus.io/)\n",
