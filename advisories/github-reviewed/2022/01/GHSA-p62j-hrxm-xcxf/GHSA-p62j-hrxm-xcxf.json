  "summary": "Book page text, count, and author/title length is not limited in PocketMine-MP",
  "details": "### Impact\nPlayers can fill book pages with as many characters as they like; the server does not check this.\nIn addition, the maximum of 50 pages is also not enforced, meaning that players can create \"book bombs\".\n\nThis causes a variety of problems:\n- Oversized NBT on the wire costing excess bandwidth for server and client\n- Server crashes when saving region-based worlds due to exceeding maximum chunk size of 1 MB (PM3-specific)\n- Server crashes if any book page exceeds 32 KiB (due to TAG_String size limit) (PM4-specific)\n\nThis does, however, require that an attacker obtain a writable book in the first place in order to exploit the problem.\n\n### Patches\nThe bug has been fixed in 3.26.5 and 4.0.5.\n\n### Workarounds\nBan writable books, or use a plugin to cancel `PlayerEditBookEvent` to cancel the event if `strlen(text) > 1024 || mb_strlen(text) > 256`.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Email us at [team@pmmp.io](mailto:team@pmmp.io)\n",
