  "summary": "Go-Attestation Improper Input Validation with attacker-controlled TPM Quote",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nAn improper input validation vulnerability in go-attestation before 0.4.0 allows local users to provide a maliciously-formed Quote over no/some PCRs, causing `AKPublic.Verify` to succeed despite the inconsistency. Subsequent use of the same set of PCR values in `Eventlog.Verify` lacks the authentication performed by quote verification, meaning a local attacker could couple this vulnerability with a maliciously-crafted TCG log in `Eventlog.Verify` to spoof events in the TCG log, hence defeating remotely-attested measured-boot.\n\n### Patches\nThis issue is resolved in version 0.4.0. If your usage of this library verifies PCRs using multiple quotes, make sure to use the new method `AKPublic.VerifyAll()` instead of `AKPublic.Verify`.",
