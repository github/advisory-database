  "summary": "Class Loading Vulnerability in Artemis",
  "details": "### Impact\nThis affects all Artemis users who test Java assignments. **Ares is not required.**\nStudents code that gets automatically tested can run arbitrary code in the container,\nor arbitrary code on the machine of an assessor in case of manual correction.\n\n### Patches\nThe problem cannot be resolved easily in Ares itself. Use the Maven Enforcer Plugin as follows:\n\n```xml\n<plugin>\n    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>\n    <artifactId>maven-enforcer-plugin</artifactId>\n    <version>3.0.0</version>\n    <executions>\n        <execution>\n            <id>enforce-no-student-code-in-trusted-packages</id>\n            <phase>process-classes</phase>\n            <goals>\n                <goal>enforce</goal>\n            </goals>\n        </execution>\n    </executions>\n    <configuration>\n        <rules>\n            <requireFilesDontExist>\n                <files>\n                    <!-- ADD HERE THE RULES ARES TELLS YOU ARE MISSING -->\n                </files>\n            </requireFilesDontExist>\n        </rules>\n    </configuration>\n</plugin>\n```\n\nThis fails the build if student classes reside in such packages that Ares trusts. Trusted packages added in Ares using `@AddTrustedPackage` should be added as well.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open a discussion https://github.com/ls1intum/Ares/discussions\n* Open an issue in https://github.com/ls1intum/Ares/issues\n* Email us, see https://github.com/ls1intum/Ares/security/policy\n\n### References\nSee the assignment of Julius that passes the tests in TUM Artemis course: \"Test - Praktikum: Grundlagen der Programmierung (Testkurs für Tutoren) - Security Tests\" (if that still exists in 2022).\n\nAlso see #15 for almost the same problem.\n",
