  "summary": "GitHub CLI can execute a git binary from the current directory",
  "details": "### Impact\nGitHub CLI depends on a `git.exe` executable being found in system `%PATH%` on Windows. However, if a malicious `.\\git.exe` or `.\\git.bat` is found in the current working directory at the time of running `gh`, the malicious command will be invoked instead of the system one.\n\nWindows users who run `gh` inside untrusted directories are affected.\n\n### Patches\nUsers should upgrade to GitHub CLI v1.2.1.\n\n### Workarounds\nOther than avoiding untrusted repositories, there is no workaround.\n\n### References\nhttps://github.com/golang/go/issues/38736",
