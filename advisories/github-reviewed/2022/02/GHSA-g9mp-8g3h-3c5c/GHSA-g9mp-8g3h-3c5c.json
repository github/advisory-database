  "summary": "Improper nonce handling: potential overflow, potential state DoS",
  "details": "The Go package `github.com/flynn/noise`, a [Noise Protocol](https://noiseprotocol.org/) implementation, has two bugs in nonce handling in versions prior to v1.0.0.\n\n### Issue 1: Potential nonce overflow\n\nIf 2^64 (~18.4 quintillion) or more messages are encrypted with `Encrypt` after handshaking, the nonce counter will wrap around, causing multiple messages to be encrypted with the same key and nonce, resulting in a potentially catastrophic weakening of the security properties of the symmetric cipher.\n\nThis has been resolved in the patched version by returning `ErrMaxNonce` from the `CipherState` `Encrypt` and `Decrypt` methods before the reserved maximum nonce is reached. If this error is encountered, the program should handshake again to start with a fresh `CipherState`.\n\n### Issue 2: Potential denial of service via invalid ciphertext\n\nIf an attacker sends an invalid ciphertext into one peer's `Decrypt`, the nonce is incremented unconditionally. This causes a desync of the `CipherState` due to a nonce mismatch between the peers, resulting in a failure to decrypt all subsequent messages. A new handshake will be required to establish a new `CipherState`.\n\nThis has been resolved in the patched version by returning authentication errors from `Decrypt` before incrementing the nonce. \n\n### Patches\n\nFixed in https://github.com/flynn/noise/pull/44, tagged as v1.0.0.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThese issues were discovered during [an audit](https://www.bamsoftware.com/software/dnstt/cure53-turbotunnel-2021.pdf) of a user of this package ([dnstt](https://www.bamsoftware.com/software/dnstt/)). Thanks to UC Berkley for commissioning the audit, and to David Fifield and Nathan Brown for their collaboration on the fixes. The fixed issues are noted in the audit as:\n\n* UCB-02-003 Potential nonce overflow in Noise protocol\n* UCB-02-006 DoS due to unconditional nonce increment",
