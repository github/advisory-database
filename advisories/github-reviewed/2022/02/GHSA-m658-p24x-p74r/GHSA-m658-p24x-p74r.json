  "details": "## Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is a duplicate of GHSA-h289-x5wc-xcv8. This link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n## Original Description\nIn Mellium mellium.im/xmpp through 0.21.0, an attacker capable of spoofing DNS TXT records can redirect a WebSocket connection request to a server under their control without causing TLS certificate verification to fail. This occurs because the wrong host name is selected during this verification.",
