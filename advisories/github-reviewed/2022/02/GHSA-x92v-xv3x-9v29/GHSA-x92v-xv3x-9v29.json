  "summary": "CSRF vulnerability in Jenkins Chef Sinatra Plugin allow XXE",
  "details": "Chef Sinatra Plugin 1.20 and earlier does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation.\n\nThis allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to have Jenkins send an HTTP request to an attacker-controlled URL and have it parse the response as XML.\n\nAs the plugin does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks, attackers can have Jenkins parse a crafted XML response that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.\n\nAdditionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.",
