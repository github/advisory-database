  "summary": "Apiman Vert.x Gateway has Transitive Hazelcast connection caching issue",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nIf you are using the **Apiman Vert.x Gateway** prior to Apiman 3.0.0.Final, a connection caching issue in Hazelcast could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access and manipulate data in the cluster with another authenticated connection's identity.\n\nHazelcast is a transitive dependency of the Apiman Vert.x Gateway.\n\nThe precise risk is difficult to quantify at this juncture as plugins deployed by users may make use of Hazelcast in a different manner to the main Apiman codebase.\n\nIf any of your custom Apiman plugins specify Hazelcast dependencies, you should also bump these versions. \n\nHint: an easy way to track Apiman dependency versions is to use `apiman-parent`.\n\nIf you use the Apiman Tomcat or WildFly Gateway this does not affect you.\n\n### Patches\n\nUpgrade to **Apiman 3.0.0.Final or later**.\n\nIf you are using an older version of Apiman and need to remain on that version, contact to your Apiman support provider for advice/long-term support.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNone (other than doing your own build).\n\n### References\n\n* https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-c5hg-mr8r-f6jp",
