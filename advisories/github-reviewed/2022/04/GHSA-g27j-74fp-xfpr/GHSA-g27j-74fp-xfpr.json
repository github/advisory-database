  "summary": "Insecure default value for CORS configuration",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nThe default value for the `CORS_ENABLED` and `CORS_ORIGIN` configuration was set to be very permissive by default. This could lead to unauthorized access in uncontrolled environments when the configuration hasn't been changed.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe default values for CORS have been changed in https://github.com/directus/directus/pull/12022 which is released under 9.7.0\n\n### Workarounds\n\nConfigure the CORS environment variables to match your project's usage, rather than leaving them at the (permissive) defaults.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [directus/directus](https://github.com/directus/directus)\n* Email us at [security@directus.io](mailto:security@directus.io)\n",
