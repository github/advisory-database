  "summary": "October CMS upload process vulnerable to RCE via Race Condition",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nThis advisory affects plugins that expose the `October\\Rain\\Database\\Attach\\File::fromData` as a public interface. This vulnerability does not affect vanilla installations of October CMS since this method is not exposed or used by the system internally or externally.\n\nWhen the developer allows the user to specify their own filename in the `fromData` method, an unauthenticated user can perform remote code execution (RCE) by exploiting a race condition in the temporary storage directory.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue has been patched in Build 476 (v1.0.476) and v1.1.12 and v2.2.15.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nApply https://github.com/octobercms/library/commit/fe569f3babf3f593be2b1e0a4ae0283506127a83 to your installation manually if unable to upgrade to Build 476 (v1.0.476) or v1.1.12 or v2.2.15.\n\n### References\n\nCredits to:\n- DucNT, HungTD and GiangVQ from RedTeam@VNG Security Response Center.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n- Email us at [hello@octobercms.com](mailto:hello@octobercms.com)",
