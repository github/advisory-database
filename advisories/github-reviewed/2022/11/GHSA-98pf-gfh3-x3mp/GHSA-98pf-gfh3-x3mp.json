  "summary": "Read the Docs vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nThis vulnerability allowed a malicious user to serve arbitrary HTML files from the main application domain (readthedocs[.]org/readthedocs[.]com) by exploiting a vulnerability in the code that serves downloadable content from a project. \n\nExploiting this would have required the attacker to get a logged-in user to visit the malicious URL, which would have allowed the attacker to take control of the user's session with JavaScript (making requests to the API/site on behalf of the user). This URL would have looked something like `hxxps[:]//readthedocs[.]org/projects/attacker-project/downloads/html/version-with-javascript-attack/`.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue has been patched in our 8.8.1 release.",
