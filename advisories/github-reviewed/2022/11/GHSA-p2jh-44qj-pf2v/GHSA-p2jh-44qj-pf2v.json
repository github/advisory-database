  "summary": "Exfiltration of hashed SMB credentials on Windows via file:// redirect",
  "details": "### Impact\nWhen following a redirect, Electron delays a check for redirecting to file:// URLs from other schemes. The contents of the file is not available to the renderer following the redirect, but if the redirect target is a SMB URL such as `file://some.website.com/`, then in some cases, Windows will connect to that server and attempt NTLM authentication, which can include sending hashed credentials.\n\n### Patches\nThis issue has been fixed in all current stable versions of Electron. Specifically, these versions contain the fixes:\n\n- 21.0.0-beta.1\n- 20.0.1\n- 19.0.11\n- 18.3.7\n\nWe recommend all apps upgrade to the latest stable version of Electron.\n\n### Workarounds\nIf upgrading isn't possible, this issue can be addressed without upgrading by preventing redirects to file:// URLs in the `WebContents.on('will-redirect')` event, for all WebContents:\n\n```js\napp.on('web-contents-created', (e, webContents) => {\n  webContents.on('will-redirect', (e, url) => {\n    if (/^file:/.test(url)) e.preventDefault()\n  })\n})\n```\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, email us at [security@electronjs.org](mailto:security@electronjs.org).\n\n### Credit\nThanks to user @coolcoolnoworries for reporting this issue.",
