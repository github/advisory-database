  "summary": "OS Command Injection in Apache Airflow",
  "details": "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') vulnerability in Apache Airflow Hive Provider, Apache Airflow allows an attacker to execute arbtrary commands in the task execution context, without write access to DAG files.

It also impacts any Apache Airflow versions prior to 2.3.0 in case HIve Provider is installed (Hive Provider 4.1.0 can only be installed for Airflow 2.3.0+). Note that you need to manually install the HIve Provider version 4.1.0 in order to get rid of the vulnerability on top of Airflow 2.3.0+ version that has lower version of the Hive Provider installed).",
