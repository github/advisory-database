  "summary": "Client Certificates are accepted without CertificateVerify",
  "details": "### Impact\nA DTLS Client could provide a Certificate that it doesn't posses the private key for and Pion DTLS wouldn't reject it. \n\nThis issue affects users that are using Client certificates only. The connection itself is still secure. The Certificate provided by clients can't be trusted when using a Pion DTLS server prior to v2.1.5\n\n### Patches\nUpgrade to Pion DTLS v2.1.5\n\n### Workarounds\nNo workarounds available, upgrade to Pion DTLS v2.1.5\n\n### References\nThank you to [Juho Nurminen](https://github.com/jupenur) and the Mattermost team for discovering and reporting this. \n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [Pion DTLS](http://github.com/pion/dtls)\n* Email us at [team@pion.ly](mailto:team@pion.ly)",
