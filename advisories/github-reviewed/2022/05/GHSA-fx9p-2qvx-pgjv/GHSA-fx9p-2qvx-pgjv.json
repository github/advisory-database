  "summary": "Jenkins ElectricFlow Plugin is vulnerable to stored cross site scripting vulnerability",
  "details": "The plugin adds metadata displayed on build pages during its operations.\n\nAny user content was not escaped, resulting in a cross-site scripting vulnerability allowing users with Job/Configure permission, or attackers controlling API responses received from ElectricFlow to render arbitrary HTML and JavaScript on Jenkins build pages.\n\nBuild metadata is now filtered through a HTML formatter that only allows showing basic HTML, neutralizing any unsafe data. Additionally, all builds executed after the security update is applied will now properly escape content received from ElectricFlow.",
