  "summary": "XXE vulnerability in Jenkins Nerrvana Plugin",
  "details": "Nerrvana Plugin 1.02.06 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.\n\nThis allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to have Jenkins parse a crafted HTTP request with XML data that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.\n\nAdditionally, XML parsing is exposed as a form validation endpoint that does not require POST requests, allowing exploitation by users without Overall/Read permission via CSRF.",
