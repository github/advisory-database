  "details": "Email Extension Plugin stores an SMTP password in its global configuration file `hudson.plugins.emailext.ExtendedEmailPublisher.xml` on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.\n\nWhile this password is stored encrypted on disk, it is transmitted and displayed in plain text as part of the configuration form by Email Extension Plugin 2.72 and 2.73. This can result in exposure of the password.\n\nEmail Extension Plugin 2.74 transmits the SMTP password in its global configuration encrypted and masks it using a password field.",
