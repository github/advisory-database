  "summary": "Authentication cache in Active Directory Jenkins Plugin allows logging in with any password",
  "details": "Active Directory Plugin implements two separate modes: Integration with ADSI on Windows, and an OS agnostic LDAP-based mode. Optionally, to reduce lookup time, a cache can be configured to remember user lookups and user authentications.\\n\\nIn Active Directory Plugin 2.19 and earlier, when run in Windows/ADSI mode, the provided password was not used when looking up an applicable cache entry. This allows attackers to log in as any user using any password while a successful authentication of that user is still in the cache.\\n\\nAs a workaround for this issue, the cache can be disabled.\\n\\nActive Directory Plugin 2.20 includes the provided password in cache entry lookup.\\n\\nAdditionally, the Java system property `hudson.plugins.active_directory.CacheUtil.noCacheAuth` can be set to `true` to no longer cache user authentications.",
