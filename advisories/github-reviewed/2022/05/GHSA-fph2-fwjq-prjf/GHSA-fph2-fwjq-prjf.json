  "summary": "Users with Overall/Read access could enumerate credentials IDs in Jenkins Fortify on Demand Plugin",
  "details": "Fortify on Demand Plugin provides a list of applicable credentials IDs to allow users configuring the plugin to select the one to use.\n\nThis functionality does not correctly check permissions in Fortify on Demand Plugin 6.0.0 and earlier, allowing any user with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs. Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.\n\nAn enumeration of credentials IDs in Fortify on Demand Plugin 6.0.1 now requires the appropriate permissions.",
