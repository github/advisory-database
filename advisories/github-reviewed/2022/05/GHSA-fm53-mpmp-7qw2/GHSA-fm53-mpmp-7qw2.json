  "summary": "Possible cross-site scripting attack via unsanitized SVG files in FoF Upload",
  "details": "### Impact\nIf FoF Upload is configured to allow the uploading of SVG files (`image/svg+xml`), navigating directly to an SVG file URI could execute arbitrary Javascript code decided by an attacker.\n\nThis Javascript code could include the execution of HTTP web requests to Flarum, or any other web service. This could allow data to be leaked by an authenticated Flarum user, or, possibly, for data to be modified maliciously.\n\n### Patches\nThis has been patched with v1.2.3, which now sanitizes uploaded SVG files.\n\n### Workarounds\nUpgrade to `1.2.3` (requires Flarum 1.2 or later), or remove the ability for users to upload SVG files through FoF Upload.\n\n### References\nThank you to Safwat Refaat for the responsible disclosure of this vulnerability.\n",
