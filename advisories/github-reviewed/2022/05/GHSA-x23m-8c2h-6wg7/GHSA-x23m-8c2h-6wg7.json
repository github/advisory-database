  "details": "Redgate SQL Change Automation Plugin 2.0.4 and earlier stores a NuGet API key unencrypted in job config.xml files as part of its configuration. This credential could be viewed by users with Extended Read permission or access to the Jenkins controller file system.\n\nThis is due to an incomplete fix of [SECURITY-1598](https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisory/2019-12-17/#SECURITY-1598).\n\nRedgate SQL Change Automation Plugin 2.0.5 now stores the API key encrypted. Existing jobs need to have their configuration saved for existing plain text passwords to be overwritten.",
