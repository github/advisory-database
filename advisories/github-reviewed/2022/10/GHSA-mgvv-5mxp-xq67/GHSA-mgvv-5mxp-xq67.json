  "summary": "SQLite3 addresses vulnerability in packaged version of libsqlite",
  "details": "### Summary\n\nThe rubygem sqlite3 v1.5.1 upgrades the packaged version of libsqlite from v3.39.3 to [v3.39.4](https://sqlite.org/releaselog/3_39_4.html).\n\nlibsqlite v3.39.4 addresses a vulnerability described as follows in the release notification:\n\n> Version 3.39.4 is a minimal patch against the prior release that addresses issues found since the\n> prior release. In particular, a potential vulnerability in the FTS3 extension has been fixed, so\n> this should be considered a security update.\n>\n> In order to exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must have full SQL access and must be able to\n> construct a corrupt database with over 2GB of FTS3 content. The problem arises from a 32-bit\n> signed integer overflow.\n\nThis vulnerability has not been assigned a CVE and does not have a severity declared.\n\nPlease note that this advisory only applies to the sqlite3 gem v1.5.0, and only if the packaged libsqlite is being used. If you've overridden defaults at installation time to use system libraries instead of packaged libraries, you should instead pay attention to your distro's libsqlite release announcements.\n\n\n### Mitigation\n\nUpgrade to the rubygem sqlite3 v1.5.1 or later.\n\nUsers who are unable to upgrade the sqlite3 gem may also choose a more complicated mitigation: compile and link sqlite3 against external libsqlite >= 3.39.4 which will also address these same issues.\n\n\n### References\n\n- Upstream release notes: https://sqlite.org/releaselog/3_39_4.html\n- Instructions for compiling against system libraries: https://github.com/sparklemotion/sqlite3-ruby",
