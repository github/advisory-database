  "details": "### Overview\nDuring our internal security assessment, it was discovered that OpenFGA versions `v0.2.3` and prior are vulnerable to authorization bypass under certain conditions.\n\n### Am I affected?\nYou are affected by this vulnerability if you are using `openfga/openfga` version `v0.2.3` and you added a tuple with a wildcard (*) assigned to a tupleset relation (the right hand side of a ‘from’ statement).\n\n### How to fix that?\nUpgrade to version `v0.2.4`.\n\n### Backward Compatibility\nThis update is not backward compatible with any authorization model that uses wildcard on a tupleset relation.\n\n",
