  "summary": "Stored XSS vulnerability in Jenkins Pipeline: Supporting APIs Plugin",
  "details": "Pipeline: Supporting APIs Plugin provides a feature to add hyperlinks, that send POST requests when clicked, to build logs. These links are used by Pipeline: Input Step Plugin to allow users to proceed or abort the build, or by Pipeline: Job Plugin to allow users to forcibly terminate the build after aborting it.\n\nPipeline: Supporting APIs Plugin 838.va_3a_087b_4055b and earlier does not sanitize or properly encode URLs of these hyperlinks in build logs.\n\nThis results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to create Pipelines.\n\nPipeline: Supporting APIs Plugin 839.v35e2736cfd5c properly encodes URLs of these hyperlinks in build logs.",
