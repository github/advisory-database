  "details": "SWHKD is a display protocol-independent hotkey daemon made in Rust. In SWHKD versions 1.1.5 and prior, SWHKD uses the /tmp/swhkd.pid pathname. As /tmp is accessible to all users, there can be an information leak or denial of service. No known workarounds exist. A patch is available on the `1.1.0` branch of the repository.",
