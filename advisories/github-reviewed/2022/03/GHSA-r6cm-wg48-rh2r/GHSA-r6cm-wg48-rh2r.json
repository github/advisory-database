  "summary": "Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor in alextselegidis/easyappointments",
  "details": "The software is a booking management system that has a public form to place bookings, and a private area for the calendar and management of services, users, settings, etc...\n\nThere is a backend API that allows data manipulation, including listing the appointments for a specific time range.\n\nThis happens on this endpoint: /index.php/backend_api/ajax_get_calendar_events\n\nUnfortunately, there is no authentication / permissions-check on that endpoint, the only required parameters in a POST request are \"startDate\", \"endDate\" and \"csrfToken\".\n\nBecause the csrfToken can be obtained by any unauthenticated user just visiting the public form (and is valid for the backend as well), any attacker can query the backend API and obtain all sorts of private information about the appointment, in JSON format.",
