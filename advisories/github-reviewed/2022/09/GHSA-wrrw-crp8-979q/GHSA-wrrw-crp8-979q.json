  "summary": "Pageflow vulnerable to sensitive user data extraction via Ransack query injection",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nThe attack allows extracting sensitive properties of database objects that are associated with users or entries belonging to an account that the attacker has access to.\n\nPageflow uses the `ActiveAdmin` Ruby library to provide some management features to its users. `ActiveAdmin` relies on the `Ransack` library to implement search functionality. In its default configuration, `Ransack` will allow for query conditions based on properties of associated database objects [1]. The `*_starts_with`, `*_ends_with` or `*_contains` search matchers [2] can then be abused to exfiltrate sensitive string values of associated database objects via character-by-character brute-force.\n\n[1] https://activerecord-hackery.github.io/ransack/going-further/associations/\n[2] https://activerecord-hackery.github.io/ransack/getting-started/search-matches/\n\n### Mitigation\n\nUpgrade to version 15.7.1 or 14.5.2 of the `pageflow` gem.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory email us at info(at)codevise.de \n\n### Credits\n\n[Positive Security](https://positive.security/)\n\n\n",
