  "summary": "TYPO3 CMS vulnerable to Denial of Service in Page Error Handling",
  "details": "> ### Meta\n> * CVSS: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:F/RL:O/RC:C` (5.5)\n\n### Problem\nRequesting invalid or non-existing resources via HTTP triggers the page error handler which again could retrieve content  to be shown as an error message from another page. This leads to a scenario in which the application is calling itself recursively - amplifying the impact of the initial attack until the limits of the web server are exceeded.\n\nThis vulnerability is the same as described in [TYPO3-CORE-SA-2021-005](https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2021-005) ([CVE-2021-21359](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21359)). A regression, introduced during TYPO3 v11 development, led to this situation.\n\n### Solution\nUpdate to TYPO3 version 11.5.16 that fixes the problem described above.\n\n### Credits\nThanks to Rik Willems who reported this issue and to TYPO3 core & security team member Oliver Hader who fixed the issue.\n\n### References\n* [TYPO3-CORE-SA-2022-006](https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2022-006)",
