  "summary": "NuProcess vulnerable to command-line injection through insertion of NUL character(s)",
  "details": "### Impact\nIn all the versions of NuProcess where it forks processes by using the JVM's Java_java_lang_UNIXProcess_forkAndExec method (1.2.0+), attackers can use NUL characters in their strings to perform command line injection. Java's ProcessBuilder isn't vulnerable because of a check in ProcessBuilder.start. NuProcess is missing that check.\n\nThis vulnerability can only be exploited to inject command line arguments on Linux.\n- On macOS, any argument with a NUL character is truncated at that character. This means the malicious arguments are never seen by the started process.\n- On Windows, the entire command line is truncated at the first NUL character. This means the malicious arguments, and any intentional arguments provided after them, are never seen by the started process.\n\n### Patches\n2.0.5\n\n### Workarounds\nUsers of the library can sanitize command strings to remove NUL characters prior to passing them to NuProcess for execution.\n\n### References\nNone.\n",
