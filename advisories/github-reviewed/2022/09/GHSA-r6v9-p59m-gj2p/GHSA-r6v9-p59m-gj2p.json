  "summary": "Indy's NODE_UPGRADE transaction vulnerable to remote code execution",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nThe `pool-upgrade` request handler in Indy-Node `<=1.12.4` allows an improperly authenticated attacker to remotely execute code on nodes within the network.\n\nNetwork operators are strongly encouraged to upgrade to the latest Indy-Node release `>=1.12.5` as soon as possible.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe `pool-upgrade` request handler in Indy-Node `>=1.12.5` has been updated to properly authenticate `pool-upgrade` transactions before any processing is performed by the request handler.  The transactions are further sanitized to prevent remote code execution.\n\n### Mitigations\n\nNetwork operators are strongly encouraged to upgrade to the latest Indy-Node release `>=1.12.5` as soon as possible.\n\n### Acknowledgements\nThank you to @shakreiner at CyberArk Labs for finding and responsibly disclosing this issue.",
