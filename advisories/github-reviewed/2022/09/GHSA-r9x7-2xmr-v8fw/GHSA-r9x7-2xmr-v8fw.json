  "summary": "mangadex-downloader vulnerable to unauthorized file reading",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nWhen using `file:<location>` command and `<location>` is web URL location (http, https). mangadex-downloader will try to open and read a file in local disk for each line of website content. \n\nSo far, the app only read the files and not execute it. But still, when someone reading your files without you knowing, it's very scary.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUnfortunately, there is no workarounds to make it safe from this issue. But i suggest you double check the url before proceed to download or update to latest version ( >= 1.7.2)\n\n### Patches\n\nFixed in version 1.7.2\n\n### Reference\n\n- https://github.com/mansuf/mangadex-downloader/blob/v1.7.1/mangadex_downloader/cli/validator.py\n- Commit patch: https://github.com/mansuf/mangadex-downloader/commit/439cc2825198ebc12b3310c95c39a8c7710c9b42",
