  "summary": "Rubyzip gem contains a Directory Traversal vulnerability in zip file component",
  "details": "rubyzip gem rubyzip version 1.2.1 and earlier contains a Directory Traversal vulnerability in Zip::File component that can result in write arbitrary files to the filesystem. This attack appear to be exploitable via If a site allows uploading of .zip files , an attacker can upload a malicious file that contains symlinks or files with absolute pathnames \"../\" to write arbitrary files to the filesystem..\n\nThis is similar to CVE-2017-5946 which was patched in 1.2.1 but the fix in that case was incomplete.",
