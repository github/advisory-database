  "summary": "Large gzip Denial of Service in superagent",
  "details": "Affected versions of `superagent` do not check the post-decompression size of ZIP compressed HTTP responses prior to decompressing. This results in the package being vulnerable to a [ZIP bomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_bomb) attack, where an extremely small ZIP file becomes many orders of magnitude larger when decompressed. \n\nThis may result in unrestrained CPU/Memory/Disk consumption, causing a denial of service condition.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpdate to version 3.7.0 or later.",
