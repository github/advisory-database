  "summary": "Code Injection in js-yaml",
  "details": "Versions of `js-yaml` prior to 3.13.1 are vulnerable to Code Injection. The `load()` function may execute arbitrary code injected through a malicious YAML file. Objects that have `toString` as key, JavaScript code as value and are used as explicit mapping keys allow attackers to execute the supplied code through the `load()` function. The `safeLoad()` function is unaffected.\n\nAn example payload is \n`{ toString: !<tag:yaml.org,2002:js/function> 'function (){return Date.now()}' } : 1` \nwhich returns the object \n{\n  \"1553107949161\": 1\n}\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpgrade to version 3.13.1.",
