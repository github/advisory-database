  "summary": "Command Injection in open",
  "details": "Versions of `open` before 6.0.0 are vulnerable to command injection when unsanitized user input is passed in.\n\nThe package does come with the following warning in the readme:\n\n```\nThe same care should be taken when calling open as if you were calling child_process.exec directly. If it is an executable it will run in a new shell.\n```\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\n`open` is now the deprecated `opn` package. Upgrading to the latest version is likely have unwanted effects since it now has a very different API but will prevent this vulnerability.",
