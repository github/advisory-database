  "summary": "SQL Injection in sequelize",
  "details": "Affected versions of `sequelize` cast arrays to strings and fail to properly escape the resulting SQL statement, resulting in a SQL injection vulnerability.\n\n\n## Proof of Concept\nIn Postgres, SQLite, and Microsoft SQL Server there is an issue where arrays are treated as strings and improperly escaped.\n\nExample Query:\n```\ndatabase.query('SELECT * FROM TestTable WHERE Name IN (:names)', {\n  replacements: {\n    names: directCopyOfUserInput\n  }\n});\n```\n\nIf the user inputs the value of `:names` as:\n```\n[\"test\", \"'); DELETE TestTable WHERE Id = 1 --')\"]\n```\n\nThe resulting SQL statement will be:\n```\nSELECT Id FROM Table WHERE Name IN ('test', '\\'); DELETE TestTable WHERE Id = 1 --')\n```\nAs the backslash has no special meaning in PostgreSQL, MSSQL, or SQLite, the statement will delete the record in TestTable with an Id of 1.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpdate to version 3.20.0 or later.",
