  "summary": "Sanitization bypass using HTML Entities in marked",
  "details": "Affected versions of `marked` are susceptible to a cross-site scripting vulnerability in link components when `sanitize:true` is configured. \n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nThis flaw exists because link URIs containing HTML entities get processed in an abnormal manner. Any HTML Entities get parsed on a best-effort basis and included in the resulting link, while if that parsing fails that character is omitted.\n\nFor example:\n\nA link URI such as\n```\njavascript&#x58document;alert&#40;1&#41;\n```\nRenders a valid link that when clicked will execute `alert(1)`.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpdate to version 0.3.6 or later.",
