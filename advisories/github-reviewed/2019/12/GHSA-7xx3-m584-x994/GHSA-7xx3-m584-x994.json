  "summary": "A poorly-behaved client could use keepalive requests to monopolize Puma's reactor and create a denial of service attack",
  "details": "## Keepalive thread overload/DoS\n\n### Impact\n\nA poorly-behaved client could use keepalive requests to monopolize Puma's reactor and create a denial of service attack.\n\nIf more keepalive connections to Puma are opened than there are threads available, additional connections will wait permanently if the attacker sends requests frequently enough.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis vulnerability is patched in Puma 4.3.1 and 3.12.2.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nReverse proxies in front of Puma could be configured to always allow less than X keepalive connections to a Puma cluster or process, where X is the number of threads configured in Puma's thread pool.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* Open an issue at [puma](github.com/puma/puma).",
