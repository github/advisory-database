Run `pwsh -v`, then, check the version in the table in [Affected Software](#user-content-affected-software) to see if your version of PowerShell Core is affected.\n1. If you are running a version of PowerShell Core where the executable is not `pwsh` or `pwsh.exe`, then you are affected.  This only existed for preview version of `6.0`.\n\n### How do I update to an unaffected version?\n\nFollow the instructions at [Installing PowerShell Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/setup/installing-powershell?view=powershell-6) to install the latest version of PowerShell Core.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in PowerShell Core,\nplease email details to secure@microsoft.com.\n\n### Support\n\nYou can ask questions about this issue on GitHub in the PowerShell organization.\nThis is located at https://github.com/PowerShell/.\nThe Announcements repo (https://github.com/PowerShell/Announcements)\nwill contain this bulletin as an issue and will include a link to a discussion issue where you can ask questions.\n\n### What if the update breaks my script or module?\n\nYou can uninstall the newer version of PowerShell Core and install the previous version of PowerShell Core.\nThis should be treated as a temporary measure.\nTherefore, the script or module should be updated to work with the patched version of PowerShell Core.\n\n### Acknowledgments\n\nMicrosoft recognizes the efforts of those in the security community who help us protect customers through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.\n\nSee [acknowledgments](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-us/security-guidance/acknowledgments) for more information.\n\n### External Links\n\n[CVE-2019-1167](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-1167)\n\n### Revisions\n\nV1.0 (July 16, 2019): Advisory published.\n\n*Version 1.0*\n*Last Updated 2019-07-16*",
