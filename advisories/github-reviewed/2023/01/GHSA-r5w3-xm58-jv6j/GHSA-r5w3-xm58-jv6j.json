  "summary": "Cargo did not verify SSH host keys",
  "details": "The Rust Security Response WG was notified that Cargo did not perform SSH host key verification when cloning indexes and dependencies via SSH. An attacker could exploit this to perform man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.\n\nThis vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2022-46176.\n\n## Overview\n\nWhen an SSH client establishes communication with a server, to prevent MITM attacks the client should check whether it already communicated with that server in the past and what the server's public key was back then. If the key changed since the last connection, the connection must be aborted as a MITM attack is likely taking place.\n\nIt was discovered that Cargo never implemented such checks, and performed no validation on the server's public key, leaving Cargo users vulnerable to MITM attacks.\n\n## Affected Versions\n\nAll Rust versions containing Cargo before 1.66.1 are vulnerable.\n\nNote that even if you don't explicitly use SSH for alternate registry indexes or crate dependencies, you might be affected by this vulnerability if you have configured git to replace HTTPS connections to GitHub with SSH (through git's [`url.<base>.insteadOf`][1] setting), as that'd cause you to clone the crates.io index through SSH.\n\n## Mitigations\n\nWe will be releasing Rust 1.66.1 today, 2023-01-10, changing Cargo to check the SSH host key and abort the connection if the server's public key is not already trusted. We recommend everyone to upgrade as soon as possible.\n\nPatch files for Rust 1.66.0 are also available [here](https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-security-response/tree/main/patches/CVE-2022-46176) for custom-built toolchains.\n\nFor the time being Cargo will not ask the user whether to trust a server's public key during the first connection. Instead, Cargo will show an error message detailing how to add that public key to the list of trusted keys. Note that this might break your automated builds if the hosts you clone dependencies or indexes from are not already trusted.",
