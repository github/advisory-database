  ],
  "summary": "Gitops Run insecure communication",
  "details": "### Impact\nGitOps run has a local S3 bucket which it uses for synchronising files that are later applied against a Kubernetes cluster. The communication between GitOps Run and the local s3 bucket is not encrypted. \n\nThis allows privileged users or process to tap the local traffic to gain information permitting access to the s3 bucket. From that point, it would be possible to alter the bucket content, resulting in changes in the Kubernetes cluster's resources(e.g. CVE-2022-23508).\n\n### Patches\nThis vulnerability has been fixed by commits [ce2bbff](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave-gitops/pull/3106/commits/ce2bbff0a3609c33396050ed544a5a21f8d0797f) and [babd915](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave-gitops/pull/3098/commits/babd91574b99b310b84aeec9f8f895bd18acb967). Users should upgrade to Weave GitOps version >= v0.12.0 released on 08/12/2022.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere is no workaround for this vulnerability.\n\n### References\nDisclosed by Paulo Gomes, Senior Software Engineer, Weaveworks.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n- Open an issue in [Weave GitOps repository](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave-gitops)\n- Email us at [support@weave.works](mailto:support@weave.works)\n",
