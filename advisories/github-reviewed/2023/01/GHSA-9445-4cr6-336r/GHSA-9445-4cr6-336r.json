  "summary": "Open Redirect Vulnerability in Action Pack",
  "details": "There is a vulnerability in Action Controller’s redirect_to. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2023-22797.\n\nVersions Affected: >= 7.0.0 Not affected: < 7.0.0 Fixed Versions: 7.0.4.1\nImpact\n\nThere is a possible open redirect when using the redirect_to helper with untrusted user input.\n\nVulnerable code will look like this:\n```\nredirect_to(params[:some_param])\n```\n\nRails 7.0 introduced protection against open redirects from calling redirect_to with untrusted user input. In prior versions the developer was fully responsible for only providing trusted input. However the check introduced could be bypassed by a carefully crafted URL.\n\nAll users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.\nReleases\n\nThe FIXED releases are available at the normal locations.\nWorkarounds\n\nThere are no feasible workarounds for this issue.\nPatches\n\nTo aid users who aren’t able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for the two supported release series. They are in git-am format and consist of a single changeset.\n\n    7-0-Fix-sec-issue-with-_url_host_allowed.patch - Patch for 7.0 series\n\nPlease note that only the 7.0.Z and 6.1.Z series are supported at present, and 6.0.Z for severe vulnerabilities. Users of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade as soon as possible as we cannot guarantee the continued availability of security fixes for unsupported releases.",
