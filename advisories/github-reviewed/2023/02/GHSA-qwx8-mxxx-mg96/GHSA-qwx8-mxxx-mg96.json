  "summary": "wallabag contains Improper Authorization via export feature",
  "details": "# Description\n\nThe export feature lets a user export a single entry or a set of entries in a given format (_e.g. PDF, MOBI, TXT_).\n\nFor example, `https://yourinstance.wallabag.org/export/45.pdf` will export the entry with id 45 in PDF format.\n\nSince wallabag 2.0.0-alpha.1, this feature is vulnerable to an insecure direct object reference attack. A logged user can export any single entry without ownership validation.\n\nThis is due to a lack of access validation in the `downloadEntryAction` method.\n\n**You should immediately patch your instance to version 2.5.3 or higher if you have more than one user and/or having open registration.**\n\n# Resolution\n\nA user check is now done in the vulnerable method before sending the exported entry.\n\nThe `Entry` retrieval through a `ParamConverter` has also been replaced with a call to the `EntryRepository` in order to prevent any information disclosure through response discrepancy.\n\n# Workaround\n\nIf you are unable to update to the latest version or if you want to temporarily limit risk of exploitation, you may consider blocking requests to the endpoint `/export/*`.\n\nE.g. with nginx:\n\n``` nginx\n    location /export {\n        deny all;\n    }\n```\n\n# Credits\n\nWe would like to thank @bAuh0lz for reporting this issue through huntr.dev.\n\nReference: https://www.huntr.dev/bounties/3adef66f-fc86-4e6d-a540-2ffa59342ff0/ ",
