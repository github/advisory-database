  "summary": "User data in TPM attestation vulnerable to MITM",
  "details": "### Impact\nAttestation *user data* (such as the digest of the public key in an aTLS connection) was bound to the issuer's TPM, but not to its PCR state. An attacker could intercept a node initialization, initialize the node themselves, and then impersonate an uninitialized node to the validator. In practice, this meant that a CSP insider with sufficient privileges would have been able to join a node under their control to a Constellation cluster.\n\n### Patches\nThe issue has been patched in [v2.5.2](https://github.com/edgelesssys/constellation/releases/tag/v2.5.2).\n\n### Workarounds\nnone",
