  ],
  "summary": "Sentry CORS misconfiguration",
  "details": "### Impact\nThe Sentry API incorrectly returns the `access-control-allow-credentials: true` HTTP header if the `Origin` request header ends with the `system.base-hostname` option of Sentry installation. This only affects installations that have `system.base-hostname` option explicitly set, as it is empty by default.\n\nImpact is limited since recent versions of major browsers have cross-site cookie blocking enabled by default. However, this flaw could allow other multi-step attacks.\n\n### Patches\nThe patch has been released in [Sentry 23.6.2](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/releases/tag/23.6.2).\n\n### Workarounds\n\nFor Sentry SaaS customers, no action is needed.\n\nFor self-hosted Sentry installations that have `system.base-hostname` explicitly set, it is recommended to upgrade the installation to 23.6.2 or higher. There are no known workarounds.\n\n### References\n- [getsentry/sentry PR #52276](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/pull/52276)\n\n### Credits\n- [@andr0idp4r4n0id](https://twitter.com/andr0idp4r4n0id)",
