  "summary": "XWiki Platform privilege escalation (PR) from account through AWM content fields",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nAny registered user can use the content field of their user profile page to execute arbitrary scripts with programming rights, thus effectively performing rights escalation.\n\nThe problem is present [since version 4.3M2](https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-7369) when AppWithinMinutes Application added support for the Content field, allowing any wiki page (including the user profile page) to use its content as an AWM Content field, which has a custom displayer that executes the content with the rights of the ``AppWithinMinutes.Content`` author, rather than the rights of the content author.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue has been fixed in XWiki 14.10.5 and 15.1RC1 by https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/dfb1cde173e363ca5c12eb3654869f9719820262 . The fix is in the content of the [AppWithinMinutes.Content](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/dfb1cde173e363ca5c12eb3654869f9719820262#diff-850f6875c40cf7932f40a985e99679a041891c6ee75d10239c06921c0019cf78R82) page that defines the custom displayer. By using the ``display`` script service to render the content we make sure that the proper author is used for access rights checks.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you want to fix this problem on older versions of XWiki that have not been patched then you need to modify the content of ``AppWithinMinutes.Content`` page to use the ``display`` script service to render the content, like this:\n\n```\n- {{html}}$tdoc.getRenderedContent($tdoc.content, $tdoc.syntax.toIdString()).replace('{{', '&amp;#123;&amp;#123;'){{/html}}\n+ {{html}}$services.display.content($tdoc, {\n+   'displayerHint': 'default'\n+ }).replace('{{/html}}', '&amp;#123;&amp;#123;/html&amp;#125;&amp;#125;'){{/html}}\n```\n\n### References\n\n* JIRA issue https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-19906\n* Fix https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/dfb1cde173e363ca5c12eb3654869f9719820262\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [Jira XWiki.org](https://jira.xwiki.org/)\n* Email us at [Security Mailing List](mailto:security@xwiki.org)\n\n### Attribution\n\nThis vulnerability has been found and reported by @michitux .",
