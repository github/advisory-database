  "summary": "Woodpecker does not validate webhook before changing any data",
  "details": "### Impact\nAn attacker can post malformed webhook data witch lead to an update of the repository data that can e.g. allow the takeover of an repo.\nThis is only critical if the CI is configured for public usage and connected to a forge witch is also in public usage.\n\n### Patches\nPlease use either next or the latest v1.0 e.g. v1.0.2\n\n### Workarounds\nSecure the CI system by making it inaccessible to untrusted entities, for example, by placing it behind a firewall.\n\n### References\nFix: https://github.com/woodpecker-ci/woodpecker/pull/2221\nBackport: https://github.com/woodpecker-ci/woodpecker/pull/2222",
