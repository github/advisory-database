  "summary": "libp2p nodes vulnerable to attack using large RSA keys",
  "details": "### Impact\nA malicious peer can use large RSA keys to run a resource exhaustion attack & force a node to spend time doing signature verification of the large key. This vulnerability is present in the core/crypto module of go-libp2p and can occur during the Noise handshake and the libp2p x509 extension verification step.\nTo prevent this attack, go-libp2p now restricts RSA keys to <= 8192 bits.\n\n### Patches\nUsers should upgrade their go-libp2p versions to >=v0.27.8, >= v0.28.2, or >=v0.29.1\nTo protect your application, it's necessary to update to these patch releases **AND** to use the updated Go compiler (1.20.7 or 1.19.12, respectively)\n\n### Workarounds\nThere are no known workarounds\n\n### References\nThe Golang crypto/tls package also had this vulnerability (\"verifying certificate chains containing large RSA keys is slow” https://github.com/golang/go/issues/61460)\nFix in golang/go crypto/tls: https://github.com/golang/go/commit/2350afd2e8ab054390e284c95d5b089c142db017\nFix in quic-go https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go/pull/4012\n",
