  "details": "When this crate is given a pathological certificate chain to validate, it will spend CPU time exponential with the number of candidate certificates at each step of path building.\n\nBoth TLS clients and TLS servers that accept client certificate are affected.\n\nThis was previously reported in https://github.com/briansmith/webpki/issues/69.\n\n`rustls-webpki` is a fork of this crate which contains a fix for this issue and is actively maintained.",
