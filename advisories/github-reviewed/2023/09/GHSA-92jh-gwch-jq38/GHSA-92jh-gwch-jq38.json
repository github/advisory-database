  "summary": "PocketMine-MP server crash with certain invalid JSON payloads in `LoginPacket` due to dependency vulnerability (again)",
  "details": "### Impact\nAn attacker could crash PocketMine-MP by sending malformed JSON in `LoginPacket`.\n\nThis happened due to the particular handling of NULL types in the json mapper which accepts NULL type values in typed arrays which PocketMine-MP did not expect.\n\n Code processing arrays in the JSON data could then crash due to unexpected `NULL` elements.\n\n### Patches\nThis problem was fixed in 5.3.1 and 4.23.1 by updating JsonMapper to include the following commit: pmmp/netresearch-jsonmapper@4f90e8dab1c9df331fad7d3d89823404e882668c\n\nAn upstream patch for this issue was proposed via https://github.com/cweiske/jsonmapper/pull/211; however, as of 2024-05-15, the patch has not been accepted upstream due to debate about how to deal with the behavior. For now, a fork of JsonMapper is used by PocketMine-MP to workaround the issue.\n\n### Workarounds\nA plugin may handle `DataPacketReceiveEvent` for `LoginPacket` and check that none of the input arrays contain `NULL` where it's not expected, but this is rather cumbersome.\n\n### References\nProposed upstream patch for a behavior change: https://github.com/cweiske/jsonmapper/pull/211",
