  "summary": "PostCSS line return parsing error",
  "details": "An issue was discovered in PostCSS before 8.4.31. It affects linters using PostCSS to parse external Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). There may be `\\r` discrepancies, as demonstrated by `@font-face{ font:(\\r/*);}` in a rule.\n\nThis vulnerability affects linters using PostCSS to parse external untrusted CSS. An attacker can prepare CSS in such a way that it will contains parts parsed by PostCSS as a CSS comment. After processing by PostCSS, it will be included in the PostCSS output in CSS nodes (rules, properties) despite being originally included in a comment.",
