  "summary": "Craft CMS Remote Code Execution vulnerability",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nThis is a high-impact, low-complexity attack vector. Users running Craft installations before 4.4.15 are encouraged to update to at least that version to mitigate the issue. \n\n### Mitigations\n\n* This has been fixed in Craft 4.4.15. You should ensure you’re running at least that version.\n* Refresh your security key in case it has already been captured. You can do that by running the `php craft setup/security-key` command and copying the updated `CRAFT_SECURITY_KEY` environment variable to all production environments.\n* If you have any other private keys stored as environment variables (e.g., S3 or Stripe), refresh those as well.\n* Out of an abundance of caution, you may want to force all your users to reset their passwords in case your database was compromised. You can do that by running `php craft resave/users --set passwordResetRequired --to \"fn() => true\"`.\n\n### References\n\nhttps://github.com/craftcms/cms/commit/c0a37e15cc925c473e60e27fe64054993b867ac1#diff-47dd43d86f85161944dfcce2e41d31955c4184672d9bd9d82b948c6b01b86476\n\nhttps://github.com/craftcms/cms/commit/7359d18d46389ffac86c2af1e0cd59e37c298857\n\nhttps://github.com/craftcms/cms/commit/a270b928f3d34ad3bd953b81c304424edd57355e\n\nhttps://github.com/craftcms/cms/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md#4415---2023-07-03-critical\n",
