  "summary": "quic-go vulnerable to pointer dereference that can lead to panic",
  "details": "quic-go is an implementation of the [QUIC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9000) transport protocol in Go. By serializing an ACK frame after the CRYTPO that allows a node to complete the handshake, a remote node could trigger a nil pointer dereference (leading to a panic) when the node attempted to drop the Handshake packet number space.\n\n**Impact**\n\nAn attacker can bring down a quic-go node with very minimal effort. Completing the QUIC handshake only requires sending and receiving a few packets.\n\n**Patches**\n\n[v0.37.3](https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go/releases/tag/v0.37.3) contains a patch. Versions before v0.37.0 are not affected.",
