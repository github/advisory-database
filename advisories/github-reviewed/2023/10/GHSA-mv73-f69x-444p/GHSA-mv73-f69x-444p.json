  "summary": "Go Fiber CSRF Token Validation Vulnerability",
  "details": "A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability has been identified in the application, which allows an attacker to obtain tokens and forge malicious requests on behalf of a user. This can lead to unauthorized actions being taken on the user's behalf, potentially compromising the security and integrity of the application.\n\n## Vulnerability Details\n\nThe vulnerability is caused by improper validation and enforcement of CSRF tokens within the application. The following issues were identified:\n\n1. **Lack of Token Association**: The CSRF token was validated against tokens in storage but was not tied to the original requestor that generated it, allowing for token reuse.\n\n## Remediation\n\nTo remediate this vulnerability, it is recommended to take the following actions:\n\n1. **Update the Application**: Upgrade the application to a fixed version with a patch for the vulnerability.\n\n2. **Implement Proper CSRF Protection**: Review the updated documentation and ensure your application's CSRF protection mechanisms follow best practices.\n\n4. **Choose CSRF Protection Method**: Select the appropriate CSRF protection method based on your application's requirements, either the Double Submit Cookie method or the Synchronizer Token Pattern using sessions.\n\n5. **Security Testing**: Conduct a thorough security assessment, including penetration testing, to identify and address any other security vulnerabilities.\n\n## Defence-in-depth\n\nUsers should take additional security measures like captchas or Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) and set Session cookies with SameSite=Lax or SameSite=Strict, and the Secure and HttpOnly attributes.",
