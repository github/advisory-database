  "summary": "Fabric vulnerable to crosslinking transaction attack",
  "details": "# Short summary\n\nCombining two molecules to one another, called \"cross-linking\" results in a molecule with a chemical formula that is composed of all atoms of the original two molecules. \n\nIn Fabric, one can take a block of transactions and cross-link the transactions in a way that alters the way the peers parse the transactions. If a first peer receives a block `B` and a second peer receives a block identical to `B` but with the transactions being cross-linked, the second peer will parse transactions in a different way and thus its world state will deviate from the first peer. \n\nOrderers or peers cannot detect that a block has its transactions cross-linked, because there is a vulnerability in the way Fabric hashes the transactions of blocks. It simply and naively concatenates them, which is insecure and lets an adversary craft a \"cross-linked block\" (block with cross-linked transactions) which alters the way peers process transactions. \nFor example, it is possible to select a transaction and manipulate a peer to completely avoid processing it, without changing the computed hash of the block.\n\nAdditional validations have been added in v2.2.14 and v2.5.5 to detect potential cross-linking issues before processing blocks.\n\n## Impact\nIn V1 and V2, we only have a crash fault tolerant orderer and as such, the security model Fabric operates in is that the orderer is honest,\nbut peers may be malicious. As such, a peer that replicates a block from a malicious peer can have a state fork.\n\nIn V3 which we did not a release a GA yet (only a preview), we have a byzantine fault tolerant orderering service, so the security model that Fabric operates in such a case includes malicious orderers. If the orderer is malicious, it can cause state forks for peers, and can infect non-malicious orderers with cross-linked blocks.\n\n# Long summary\n\nIn order to create a signature on a big chunk of data  such as a block, the data needs to be \"compressed\" first to the input size of the signature algorithm.\n\nIn Fabric's case, we use a hash function which compressed a Fabric block from arbitrary size to a 32 byte string.\n\nIn order to understand the problem we need to be more specific: The block structure has three parts to it: (1) Header, (2) Transactions, and (3) Metadata.\n\nWhen hashing the block, the header and metadata are stitched together and then hashed, and this hash of the header and the metadata is what signed (it's a simplification but let's not get into details)\n\nHowever, the transactions of the block are not part of the above hash. Instead, the header contains a hash, called the \"Data hash\" and despite the fact that in the comments it is said: \"// The hash of the BlockData, by MerkleTree\", actually it is far from being the case, and that is where our problem lies.\n\nThe problem is that the way the transactions are hashed gives an attacker some freedom in manipulating the data. \n\nTo create the Data Hash, the transactions in the block are concatenated to one another, creating a big long byte array and then this big long byte array is hashed, and this is essentially the Data Hash.\n\nThe transactions in the block are a list of raw byte arrays, and when they are concatenated they look like this:\n\n`|$$$$$$$$$$$$|*************|@@@@@@@@@@@@|%%%%%%%%%|`  (The vertical lines \" | \" represent how transactions are separated in a block.)\n\nWhen the transactions are concatenated in order to be hashed, the payload that is hashed is: \n`$$$$$$$$$$$$*************@@@@@@@@@@@@%%%%%%%%%`\n\nAn adversary can't change the bytes of the concatenation, however what it can do, is to modify how transactions are encoded in the block:\n\nFor example, consider an adversary wants to manipulate a peer to skip the second transaction (******).\n\nIt can then create a block with the transactions as follows:\n\n`|$$$$$$$$$$$$*************|@@@@@@@@@@@@|%%%%%%%%%| `\n\nNotice that a block with the above transactions has the same concatenation of bytes as the original block, but the block has one less transaction - the first transaction is a concatenation of the first and second transactions in the original block.\n\nWhen the peer receives this block, it looks at the first transaction and when it parses it, it completely ignores the ***** bytes, (we will see why soon), and so, an adversary can create a block with the same hash but different transactions and this would create a fork in the network.\n \nI made a small PoC where I created a block with 2 transactions (by invoking two chaincodes at the same time) with a Raft orderer:\n\n```\n    [e][OrdererOrg.orderer] 2023-10-14 23:07:34.076 CEST 0079 INFO [orderer.consensus.etcdraft] propose -> Created block [10] with 2 transactions, there are 0 blocks in flight channel=testchannel node=1\n```\n\nBut right after creating the block, I just modified only its transaction content (without modifying the block hash) and then the peers only detect a single transaction inside that block:\n \n```\n    [e][Org2.peer0] 2023-10-14 23:07:34.079 CEST 0099 INFO [kvledger] commit -> [testchannel] Committed block [10] with 1 transaction(s) in 0ms (state_validation=0ms block_and_pvtdata_commit=0ms state_commit=0ms) commitHash=[c5ecca818da9319af2f276dd01cd1337938f20c3535dd23f95a33933a114fe84]\n```\n\nThe important takeaway from this experiment is that the peer does not detect any tempering was done to the block. If an attacker performs this attack, the network can be forked silently and no one will notice the network was forked until it's too late.\n\n \n\n# Patches\nHere is the patch I propose (the explanation is further below): \n\n```\ndiff --git a/internal/peer/gossip/mcs.go b/internal/peer/gossip/mcs.go\nindex b46df8b6a..9c3b5c8fd 100644\n--- a/internal/peer/gossip/mcs.go\n+++ b/internal/peer/gossip/mcs.go\n@@ -150,6 +150,10 @@ func (s *MSPMessageCryptoService) VerifyBlock(chainID common.ChannelID, seqNum u\n \t\treturn fmt.Errorf(\"Block with id [%d] on channel [%s] does not have metadata.

earlier, \n\nbut also ensure that if the transactions in the block are encoded into bytes, they re-create the exact split in the original block: `|$$$$$$$$$$$$|***********|@@@@@@@@@|%%%%%%%%%%%|`\n\nMore specifically, each transaction in the block is parsed and then re-encoded to bytes, and we check that the original encoding of a transaction is as the second encoding after parsing the original bytes of the transaction.\n\nThis fix keeps the legacy way of hashing transactions to create the block data hash, but also aims to check if some manipulation was done.\n\n \nTo understand why the fix works, we need to understand how protobuf, the wire protocol that Fabric uses to encode transactions (and almost anything it sends over the wire or writes to disk) encodes a transaction.\n\nA transaction is a protobuf message with two fields of bytes: (1) Payload and (2) Signature.\n\nWhen encoding a field of bytes, protobuf first writes a tag for the field (a byte) and then writes the length of the field in variable-length encoding, and then the bytes themselves.\n\nFor example, to encode a transaction, protobuf writes 10 (the tag for payload), then two bytes for the length of the payload, then the payload, and then 18, the tag for the signature, and then a single byte for the length of the signature, and finally the signature.\n\nNow, we can understand a proof sketch of why my solution works:\n\nAssume in contradiction that an adversary takes a block of transactions and changes the split of the concatenation in a way that changes the transactions for a peer:\n\nFrom `|$$$$$$$$$$$$|************|@@@@@@@@@@@|...|%%%%%%%|` to (for example): From `|$$$$$$$$$$$$************|@@@@@@@@@@@|...|%%%%%%%|` \n\nSince this split is not identical to the original split, there exists at least one transaction index of different size between the two splits. Let's look at the first transaction that is of different size.\n\nFor example, for the split:\n\n`|$$$$$$$$$$$$|************|@@@@@@@@@@@|...|%%%%%%%|`  we have two options:\n\n1.  The first transaction of different size is smaller in the new split:  `|$$$$$$$$$$$$|*****|*******|@@@@@@@@@@@|...|%%%%%%%|`  In such a case, it must contain both a payload and a signature, so it needs two fields (we can say we will return an error if one of the two is missing). If the protobuf parser detects it lacks bytes to parse a payload, it will fail with an error. Else, it has enough bytes to parse the payload, and then the signature is parsed. If the signature field is too short then we also error similarly.\n\n2. The first transaction of different size is bigger in the new split: `|$$$$$$$$$$$$|************@@@@|@@@@@@@|...|%%%%%%%|` \nIn that case, once this transaction is parsed, the extra bytes are skipped, so encoding the transaction to bytes yields a shorter byte array, and we detect a tempering.\n\n",
