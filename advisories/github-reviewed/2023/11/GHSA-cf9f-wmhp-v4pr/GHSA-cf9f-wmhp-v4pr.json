  "summary": "Cross-site Scripting potential in custom links, job buttons, and computed fields",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nAll users of Nautobot versions earlier than 1.6.6 or 2.0.5 are potentially affected.\n\nDue to incorrect usage of Django's `mark_safe()` API when rendering certain types of user-authored content, including:\n\n- custom links\n- job buttons\n- computed fields\n\nit is possible that users with permission to create or edit these types of content could craft a malicious payload (such as JavaScript code) that would be executed when rendering pages containing this content.\n\n### Patches\n_Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_\n\nWe have fixed the incorrect uses of `mark_safe()` (generally by replacing them with appropriate use of `format_html()` instead) to prevent such malicious data from being executed.\n\nUsers on Nautobot 1.6.x LTM should upgrade to v1.6.6 and users on Nautobot 2.0.x should upgrade to v2.0.5.\n\n### Workarounds\n_Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_\n\nAppropriate object permissions can and should be applied to restrict which users are permitted to create or edit the aforementioned types of user-authored content. Other than that, there is no direct fix available.\n\n### References\n_Are there any links users can visit to find out more?_\n\n- https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/4832\n- https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/4833\n- https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/utils/#django.utils.html.format_html\n- https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/utils/#django.utils.safestring.mark_safe",
