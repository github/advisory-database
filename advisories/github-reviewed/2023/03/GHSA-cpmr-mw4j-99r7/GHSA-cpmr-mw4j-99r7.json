  "summary": "Nginx alias path traversal allows unauthenticated attackers to read all files on /label_studio/core/",
  "details": "### Summary\nThe vulnerability resides on the Nginx config file:\nhttps://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio/blob/53944e6bcede75ca5c102d655013f2e5238e85e6/deploy/default.conf#L119\n\nThe pattern on location /static indicates a popular misconfiguration on Nginx servers presented in 2018 originally by Orange Tsai. This vulnerability allows an attacker to use a single path traversal payload in the matched location to traverse one directory above. This vulnerability only happens due to the location /static directive not having a slash `/` at the end, the following code shows an example of a safe configuration:\n```nginx\nlocation /static/ {\n[...]\n```\nThe vulnerability works because Nginx will think that `/static../` is a directory that should also be aliased to the folder, allowing /static/../ to be reached. In Label Studio's case, this means all files on /label_studio/core/ are exposed.\n\nOf course, this means that only Label Studio instances that were deployed using the default nginx files introducted at Mar 31, 2021.\nThis is a very easy vulnerability to fix, and just a lesser-known configuration mistake on nginx files. It's very easy to happen because all is needed is for one slash to be missing. (Off-By-One)\n\n** Proof-of-Concept (Leaking Secret Keys): **\nExploiting this vulnerability usually depends on what's on the parent folder, in Label Studio's case the most interesting file I could find that's on there by default is /label_studio/core/ . We can fetch it by simply making a request to the traversed folder.\n```bash\n# Production Label Studio docker-compose running on localhost:8080\n/t/mydata [127]$ curl localhost:8080/static../settings/label_studio.py\n\"\"\"This file and its contents are licensed under the Apache License 2.0.

(If the administrator decides not to use environment variables for some variables)\n",
