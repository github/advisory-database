  "summary": "Non-interactive Tailscale SSH sessions on FreeBSD may use the effective group ID of the tailscaled process",
  "details": "A vulnerability identified in the implementation of Tailscale SSH in FreeBSD allowed commands to be run with a higher privilege group ID than that specified by Tailscale SSH access rules.\n\n**Affected platforms**: FreeBSD\n\n**Patched Tailscale client versions**: v1.38.2 or later\n\n### What happened?\nA difference in the behavior of the FreeBSD `setgroups` system call from POSIX meant that the Tailscale client running on a FreeBSD-based operating system did not appropriately restrict groups on the host when using Tailscale SSH. When accessing a FreeBSD host over Tailscale SSH, the egid of the tailscaled process was used instead of that of the user specified in Tailscale SSH access rules.\n\n### Who is affected?\n9 tailnets with 22 FreeBSD nodes running Tailscale SSH since Tailscale v1.34 (released on 2022-12-04) may have had Tailscale SSH sessions with a higher privilege group ID than that specified in Tailscale SSH access rules.\n\nWe have notified the affected organizations where we have [security contacts](https://tailscale.com/kb/1224/contact-preferences/#setting-the-security-issues-email).\n\n### What is the impact?\nTailscale SSH commands may have been run with a higher privilege group ID than that specified in Tailscale SSH access rules if they met all of the following criteria:\n* The destination node was a FreeBSD device with Tailscale SSH enabled;\n* Tailscale SSH access rules permitted access for non-root users; and\n* A non-interactive SSH session was used.\n\n### What do I need to do?\nIf you are running Tailscale on FreeBSD, upgrade to v1.38.2 or later to remediate the issue. Admins of a tailnet can view [FreeBSD nodes with unpatched versions](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines?q=version%3A%3C1.38.2+freebsd) in the admin console.\n\nTo update the local ports tree in advance of what's available upstream, you can:\n\n1. `cd /usr/ports/security/tailscale`\n2. edit the Makefile to set `PORTVERSION` to `1.38.2`\n3. `make makesum`\n4. `make install`\n\nTailscale SSH on other platforms is not affected.\n\n### Credits\nWe would like to thank [Ryan Belgrave](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rbelgrave/) for reporting this issue.\n\n### References\n* [TS-2023-003](https://tailscale.com/security-bulletins/#ts-2023-003)\n\n\n",
