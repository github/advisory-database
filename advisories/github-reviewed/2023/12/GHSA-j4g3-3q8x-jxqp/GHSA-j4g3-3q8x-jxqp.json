  "details": "### Impact\n\nWhen used to pull source code from a private repository using a Personal Access Token (PAT), some versions of dbt-core write a URL with the PAT in plaintext to the `package-lock.yml` file.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe bug has been fixed in [dbt-core v1.7.3](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/releases/tag/v1.7.3).\n\n### Mitigations\n\nRemove any git URLs with plaintext secrets from `package-lock.yml` file(s) on servers, workstations, or in source control. Rotate any tokens that have been written to version-controlled files.",
