  "summary": "incorrect storage layout for contracts containing large arrays",
  "details": "### Impact\ncontracts containing large arrays might underallocate the number of slots they need. prior to v0.3.8, the calculation to determine how many slots a storage variable needed used `math.ceil(type_.size_in_bytes / 32)`:\n\nhttps://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/blob/6020b8bbf66b062d299d87bc7e4eddc4c9d1c157/vyper/semantics/validation/data_positions.py#L197\n\nthe intermediate floating point step can produce a rounding error if there are enough bits set in the IEEE-754 mantissa. roughly speaking, if `type_.size_in_bytes` is large (> 2**46), and slightly less than a power of 2, the calculation can overestimate how many slots are needed. if `type_.size_in_bytes` is slightly more than a power of 2, the calculation can underestimate how many slots are needed.\n\nthe following two example contracts can result in overwriting of the variable `vulnerable`:\n```vyper\nlarge_array: address[2**64 + 1]  # type_.size_in_bytes == 32 * (2**64 + 1); math.ceil(type_.size_in_bytes / 32) < 2**64 + 1\nvulnerable: uint256\n\n# writing to self.large_array[2**64] will overwrite self.vulnerable\n```\n```vyper\nlarge_dynarray: DynArray[address, 2**64]  # Dynarray has a length word in front, its size in bytes is 32 * (2**64 + 1)\nvulnerable: uint256\n\n# writing to self.large_dynarray[2**64 - 1] will overwrite self.vulnerable\n```\n\nnote that in the latter case, the risk of `vulnerable` being overwritten is relatively small, since it would cost roughly $1.45 million trillion USD at today's gas prices (gas price 20gwei, ETH ~= $1800) in order to extend the DynArray to its full container size.\n\n### Patches\npatched by v0.3.8, specifically in commit https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/commit/0bb7203b584e771b23536ba065a6efda457161bb.",
