  "summary": "Synapse has URL deny list bypass via oEmbed and image URLs when generating previews",
  "details": "### Impact\nA discovered oEmbed or image URL can bypass the `url_preview_url_blacklist` setting potentially allowing server side request forgery or bypassing network policies. Impact is limited to IP addresses allowed by the `url_preview_ip_range_blacklist` setting (by default this only allows public IPs) and by the limited information returned to the client:\n\n* For discovered oEmbed URLs, any non-JSON response or a JSON response which includes non-oEmbed information is discarded.\n* For discovered image URLs, any non-image response is discarded.\n\nSystems which have URL preview disabled (via the `url_preview_enabled` setting) or have not configured a `url_preview_url_blacklist` are not affected.\n\nBecause of the uncommon configuration required, the limited information a malicious user, and the amount of guesses/time the attack would need; the severity is rated as low.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue is fixed by #15601.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe default configuration of the `url_preview_ip_range_blacklist` should protect against requests being made to internal infrastructure, URL previews of public URLs is expected.\n\nAlternately URL previews could be disabled using the `url_preview_enabled` setting.",
