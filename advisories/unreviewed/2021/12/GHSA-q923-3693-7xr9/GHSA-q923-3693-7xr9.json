  "details": "Dalmark Systems Systeam 2.22.8 build 1724 is vulnerable to Incorrect Access Control. The Systeam application is an ERP system that uses a mixed architecture based on SaaS tenant and user management, and on-premise database and web application counterparts. A broken access control vulnerability has been found while using a temporary generated token in order to consume api resources. The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to use an api endpoint to generate a temporary JWT token that is designed to reference the correct tenant prior to authentication, to request system configuration parameters using direct api requests. The correct exploitation of this vulnerability causes sensitive information exposure. In case the tenant has an smtp credential set, the full credential information is disclosed.",
