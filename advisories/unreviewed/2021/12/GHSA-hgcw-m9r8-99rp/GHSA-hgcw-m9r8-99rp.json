  "details": "Affected versions of CODESYS Git in Versions prior to V1.1.0.0 lack certificate validation in HTTPS handshakes. CODESYS Git does not implement certificate validation by default, so it does not verify that the server provides a valid and trusted HTTPS certificate. Since the certificate of the server to which the connection is made is not properly verified, the server connection is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack.",
