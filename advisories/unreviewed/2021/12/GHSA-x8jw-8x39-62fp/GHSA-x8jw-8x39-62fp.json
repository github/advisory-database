  "details": "A vulnerability has been identified in ModelSim Simulation (All versions), Questa Simulation (All versions). The RSA white-box implementation in affected applications insufficiently protects the built-in private keys that are required to decrypt electronic intellectual property (IP) data in accordance with the IEEE 1735 recommended practice. This could allow a sophisticated attacker to discover the keys, bypassing the protection intended by the IEEE 1735 recommended practice.",
