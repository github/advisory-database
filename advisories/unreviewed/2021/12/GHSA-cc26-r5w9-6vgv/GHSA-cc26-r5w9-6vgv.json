  "details": "An issue was discovered on Victure WR1200 devices through 1.0.3. The default Wi-Fi WPA2 key is advertised to anyone within Wi-Fi range through the router's MAC address. The device default Wi-Fi password corresponds to the last 4 bytes of the MAC address of its 2.4 GHz network interface controller (NIC). An attacker within scanning range of the Wi-Fi network can thus scan for Wi-Fi networks to obtain the default key.",
