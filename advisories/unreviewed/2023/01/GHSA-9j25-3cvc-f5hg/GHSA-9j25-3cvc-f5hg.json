  "details": "The JetWidgets for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.12. This is due to missing nonce validation on the save() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to to modify the plugin's settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This can be used to enable SVG uploads that could make Cross-Site Scripting possible.",
