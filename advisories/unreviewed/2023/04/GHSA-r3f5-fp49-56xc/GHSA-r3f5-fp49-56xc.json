This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the web-based management interface on an affected device to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or to access sensitive, browser-based information.",
