  "details": "PWS Personal Weather Station Dashboard (PWS_Dashboard) LTS December 2020 (2012_lts) allows remote code execution by injecting PHP code into settings.php. Attacks can use the PWS_printfile.php, PWS_frame_text.php, PWS_listfile.php, PWS_winter.php, and PWS_easyweathersetup.php endpoints. A contributing factor is a hardcoded login password of support, which is not documented. (This is not the same as the documented setup password, which is 12345.) The issue was fixed in late 2022.",
