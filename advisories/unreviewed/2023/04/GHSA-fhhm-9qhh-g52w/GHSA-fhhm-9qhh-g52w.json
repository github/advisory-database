The AppDMClient binary file, which is used during the firmware installation process, can be modified by an attacker to bypass the digital signature check of AppUpgrade and .lge.upgrade.xml files, which are used during the firmware installation process. This indirectly allows an attacker to use a custom version of AppUpgrade and .lge.upgrade.xml files.",
