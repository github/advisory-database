  "details": "Issue summary: The AES-XTS cipher decryption implementation for 64 bit ARM\nplatform contains a bug that could cause it to read past the input buffer,\nleading to a crash.\n\nImpact summary: Applications that use the AES-XTS algorithm on the 64 bit ARM\nplatform can crash in rare circumstances. The AES-XTS algorithm is usually\nused for disk encryption.\n\nThe AES-XTS cipher decryption implementation for 64 bit ARM platform will read\npast the end of the ciphertext buffer if the ciphertext size is 4 mod 5, e.g.\n144 bytes or 1024 bytes. If the memory after the ciphertext buffer is\nunmapped, this will trigger a crash which results in a denial of service.\n\nIf an attacker can control the size and location of the ciphertext buffer\nbeing decrypted by an application using AES-XTS on 64 bit ARM, the\napplication is affected. This is fairly unlikely making this issue\na Low severity one.",
