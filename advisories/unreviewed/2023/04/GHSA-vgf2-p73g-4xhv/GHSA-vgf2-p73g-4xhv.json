  "details": "The WP Fastest Cache plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.1.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the wpfc_start_cdn_integration_ajax_request_callback function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change cdn settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
