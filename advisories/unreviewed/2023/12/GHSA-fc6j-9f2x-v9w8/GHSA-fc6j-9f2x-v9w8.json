  "details": "An insertion of sensitive information into log file vulnerability was identified in the log files for a GitHub Enterprise Server back-end service that could permit an `adversary in the middle attack` when combined with other phishing techniques. To exploit this, an attacker would need access to the log files for the GitHub Enterprise Server appliance, a backup archive created with GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities, or a service which received streamed logs. This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise Server since 3.7 and was fixed in version 3.17.19, 3.8.12, 3.9.7, 3.10.4, and 3.11.1. ",
