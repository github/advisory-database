    "CVE-2023-2449"
  ],
  "details": "The UserPro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized password resets in versions up to, and including 5.1.1. This is due to the plugin using native password reset functionality, with insufficient validation on the password reset function (userpro_process_form). The function uses the plaintext value of a password reset key instead of a hashed value which means it can easily be retrieved and subsequently used. An attacker can leverage CVE-2023-2448 and CVE-2023-2446, or another vulnerability like SQL Injection in another plugin or theme installed on the site to successfully exploit this vulnerability.",
