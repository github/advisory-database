For example in the file plugin.php, the function iv_directories_update_profile_setting() uses update_user_meta with any data provided by the ajax call, which can be used to give the logged in user admin capabilities. Since the plugins allow user registration via a custom form (even if the blog does not allow users to register) it makes any site using it vulnerable.",
