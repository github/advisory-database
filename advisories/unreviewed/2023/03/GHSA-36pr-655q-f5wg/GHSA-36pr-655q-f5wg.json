  "details": "A vulnerability in the scanning engines of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Secure Web Appliance, formerly known as Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA), could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass a configured rule, thereby allowing traffic onto a network that should have been blocked. This vulnerability exists because malformed, encoded traffic is not properly detected. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting through an affected device to a malicious server and receiving malformed HTTP responses. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass an explicit block rule and receive traffic that should have been rejected by the device.",
