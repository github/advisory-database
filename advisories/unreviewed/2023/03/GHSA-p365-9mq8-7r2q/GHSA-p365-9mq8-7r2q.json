  "details": "This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Canon imageCLASS MF644Cdw 10.02 printers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the CADM service. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the service account. Was ZDI-CAN-15802.",
