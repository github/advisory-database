  "details": "A vulnerability in the fragmentation handling code of tunnel protocol packets in Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected system to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability is due to the improper handling of large fragmented tunnel protocol packets. One example of a tunnel protocol is Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted fragmented packets to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected system to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. Note: Only traffic directed to the affected system can be used to exploit this vulnerability.",
