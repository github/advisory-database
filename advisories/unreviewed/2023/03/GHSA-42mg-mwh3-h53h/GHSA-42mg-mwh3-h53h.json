  "details": "Due to insufficient encoding of user input, SAP NetWeaver - versions 700, 701, 702, 731, 740, 750, allows an unauthenticated attacker to inject code that may expose sensitive data like user ID and password, which could lead to reflected Cross-Site scripting. These endpoints are normally exposed over the network and successful exploitation can partially impact confidentiality of the application.",
