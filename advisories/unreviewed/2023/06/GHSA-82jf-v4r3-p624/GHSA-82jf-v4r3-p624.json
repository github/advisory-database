  "details": "The WP Directory Kit plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data and loss of data due to a missing capability check on the 'ajax_public' function in versions up to, and including, 1.2.2. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete or change plugin settings, import demo data, delete Directory Kit related posts and terms, and install arbitrary plugins. A partial patch was introduced in version 1.2.0 and an additional partial patch was introduced in version 1.2.2, but the issue was not fully patched until 1.2.3.",
