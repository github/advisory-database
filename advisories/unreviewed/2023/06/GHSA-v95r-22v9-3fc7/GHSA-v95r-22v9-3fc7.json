  "details": "The Kiwi Social Share plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on the kiwi_social_share_get_option() function called via the kiwi_social_share_get_option AJAX action in version 2.1.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to read and modify arbitrary options on a WordPress site that can be used for complete site takeover. This was a previously fixed vulnerability that was reintroduced in this version.",
