  "details": "The Easy WP SMTP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass in versions up to, and including, 1.3.9. This is due to missing capability checks on the admin_init() function, in addition to insufficient input validation. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugins settings and arbitrary options on the site that can be used to inject new administrative user accounts.",
