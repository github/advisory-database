  "details": "An open redirect vulnerability exists in the /preauth Servlet in Zimbra Collaboration Suite through 9.0 and 8.8.15. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would need to have obtained a valid zimbra auth token or a valid preauth token. Once the token is obtained, an attacker could redirect a user to any URL if url sanitisation is bypassed in incoming requests. NOTE: this is similar, but not identical, to CVE-2021-34807.",
