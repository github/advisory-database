  "details": "The Essential Blocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized use of functionality due to a missing capability check on the get function in versions up to, and including, 4.0.6. This makes it possible for subscriber-level attackers to obtain plugin settings. While a nonce check is present, it is only executed when a nonce is provided. Not providing a nonce results in the nonce verification to be skipped. There is no capability check.",
