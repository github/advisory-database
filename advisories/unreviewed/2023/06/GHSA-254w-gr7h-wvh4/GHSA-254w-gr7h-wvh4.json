  ],
  "details": "The Frontend File Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Authenticated Settings Change in versions up to, and including, 18.2. This is due to lacking capability checks and a security nonce, all on the wpfm_save_settings AJAX action. This makes it possible for subscriber-level attackers to edit the plugin settings, such as the allowed upload file types.  This can lead to remote code execution through other vulnerabilities.",
