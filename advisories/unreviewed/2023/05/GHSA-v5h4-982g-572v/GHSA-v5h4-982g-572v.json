  "details": "The Wordapp plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to an use of insufficiently unique cryptographic signature on the 'wa_pdx_op_config_set' function in versions up to, and including, 1.5.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to the plugin to change the 'validation_token' in the plugin config, providing access to the plugin's remote control functionalities, such as creating an admin access URL, which can be used for privilege escalation.",
