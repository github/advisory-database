  "details": "When calling `JS::CheckRegExpSyntax` a Syntax Error could have been set which would end in calling `convertToRuntimeErrorAndClear`. A path in the function could attempt to allocate memory when none is available which would have caused a newly created Out of Memory exception to be mishandled as a Syntax Error.
