An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted L2TP packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS condition.\n\n Note: Only traffic directed to the affected system can be used to exploit this vulnerability.",
