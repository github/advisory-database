  "details": "An improper input validation flaw was found in the eBPF subsystem in the Linux kernel. The issue occurs due to a lack of proper validation of dynamic pointers within user-supplied eBPF programs prior to executing them. This may allow an attacker with CAP_BPF privileges to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of the kernel.",
