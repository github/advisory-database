  "details": "ILIAS (2013-09-12 release) contains a medium-criticality Directory Traversal local file inclusion vulnerability in the ScormAicc module. An attacker with a privileged account, typically holding the tutor role, can exploit this to gain unauthorized access to and potentially retrieve confidential files stored on the web server. The attacker can access files that are readable by the web server user www-data; this may include sensitive configuration files and documents located outside the documentRoot. The vulnerability is exploited by an attacker who manipulates the file parameter in a URL, inserting directory traversal sequences in order to access unauthorized files. This manipulation allows the attacker to retrieve sensitive files, such as /etc/passwd, potentially compromising the system's security. This issue poses a significant risk to confidentiality and is remotely exploitable over the internet.",
