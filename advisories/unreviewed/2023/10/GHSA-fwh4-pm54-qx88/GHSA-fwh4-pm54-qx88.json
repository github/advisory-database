  "details": "\nAn Origin Validation vulnerability in MAC address validation of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved on PTX10003 Series allows a network-adjacent attacker to bypass MAC address checking, allowing MAC addresses not intended to reach the adjacent LAN to be forwarded to the downstream network. Due to this issue, the router will start forwarding traffic if a valid route is present in forwarding-table, causing a loop and congestion in the downstream layer-2 domain connected to the device.\n\nThis issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved on PTX10003 Series:\n\n\n\n  *  All versions prior to 21.4R3-S4-EVO;\n  *  22.1 versions prior to 22.1R3-S3-EVO;\n  *  22.2 version 22.2R1-EVO and later versions;\n  *  22.3 versions prior to 22.3R2-S2-EVO, 22.3R3-S1-EVO;\n  *  22.4 versions prior to 22.4R2-S1-EVO, 22.4R3-EVO;\n  *  23.2 versions prior to 23.2R2-EVO.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
