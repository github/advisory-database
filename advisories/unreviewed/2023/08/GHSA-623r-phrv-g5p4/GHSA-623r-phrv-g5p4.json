  ],
  "details": "An issue was discovered in Tigergraph Enterprise 3.7.0. The TigerGraph platform allows users to define new User Defined Functions (UDFs) from C/C++ code. To support this functionality TigerGraph allows users to upload custom C/C++ code which is then compiled and installed into the platform. An attacker who has filesystem access on a remote TigerGraph system can alter the behavior of the database against the will of the database administrator; thus effectively bypassing the built in RBAC controls.",
