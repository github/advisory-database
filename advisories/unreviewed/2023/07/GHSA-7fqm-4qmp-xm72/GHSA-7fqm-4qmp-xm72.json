  "details": "An issue was discovered in Vocera Report Server and Voice Server 5.x through 5.8. There is a Path Traversal for an Unzip operation. The Vocera Report Console contains a websocket function that allows for the restoration of the database from a ZIP archive that expects a SQL import file. During the unzip operation, the code takes file paths from the ZIP archive and writes them to a Vocera temporary directory. Unfortunately, the code does not properly check if the file paths include directory traversal payloads that would escape the intended destination.",
