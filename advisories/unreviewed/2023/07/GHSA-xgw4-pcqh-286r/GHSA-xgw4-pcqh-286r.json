  "details": "Zoom for Windows clients before version 5.13.3, Zoom Rooms for Windows clients before version 5.13.5 and Zoom VDI for Windows clients before 5.13.1 contain an information disclosure vulnerability. A recent update to the Microsoft Edge WebView2 runtime used by the affected Zoom clients, transmitted text to Microsoft’s online Spellcheck service instead of the local Windows Spellcheck. Updating Zoom remediates this vulnerability by disabling the feature. Updating Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime to at least version 109.0.1481.0 and restarting Zoom remediates this vulnerability by updating Microsoft’s telemetry behavior.",
