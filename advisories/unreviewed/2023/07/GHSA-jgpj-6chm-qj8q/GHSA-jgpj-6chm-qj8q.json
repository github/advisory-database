  "details": "A flaw was found in the Quay registry. While the image labels created through Quay undergo validation both in the UI and backend by applying a regex (validation.py), the same validation is\nnot performed when the label comes from an image. This flaw allows an attacker to publish a malicious image to a public registry containing a script that can be executed via Cross-site scripting (XSS).",
