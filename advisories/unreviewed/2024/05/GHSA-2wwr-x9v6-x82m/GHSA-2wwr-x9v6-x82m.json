  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: ath12k: fix dfs-radar and temperature event locking\n\nThe ath12k active pdevs are protected by RCU but the DFS-radar and\ntemperature event handling code calling ath12k_mac_get_ar_by_pdev_id()\nwas not marked as a read-side critical section.\n\nMark the code in question as RCU read-side critical sections to avoid\nany potential use-after-free issues.\n\nNote that the temperature event handler looks like a place holder\ncurrently but would still trigger an RCU lockdep splat.\n\nCompile tested only.",
