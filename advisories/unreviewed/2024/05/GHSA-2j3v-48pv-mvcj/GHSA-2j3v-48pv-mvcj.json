  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ns390/dasd: protect device queue against concurrent access\n\nIn dasd_profile_start() the amount of requests on the device queue are\ncounted. The access to the device queue is unprotected against\nconcurrent access. With a lot of parallel I/O, especially with alias\ndevices enabled, the device queue can change while dasd_profile_start()\nis accessing the queue. In the worst case this leads to a kernel panic\ndue to incorrect pointer accesses.\n\nFix this by taking the device lock before accessing the queue and\ncounting the requests. Additionally the check for a valid profile data\npointer can be done earlier to avoid unnecessary locking in a hot path.",
