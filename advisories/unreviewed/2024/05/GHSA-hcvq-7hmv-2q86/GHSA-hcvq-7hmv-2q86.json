  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/usb: kalmia: Don't pass act_len in usb_bulk_msg error path\n\nsyzbot reported that act_len in kalmia_send_init_packet() is\nuninitialized when passing it to the first usb_bulk_msg error path. Jiri\nPirko noted that it's pointless to pass it in the error path, and that\nthe value that would be printed in the second error path would be the\nvalue of act_len from the first call to usb_bulk_msg.[1]\n\nWith this in mind, let's just not pass act_len to the usb_bulk_msg error\npaths.\n\n1: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/Y9pY61y1nwTuzMOa@nanopsycho/",
