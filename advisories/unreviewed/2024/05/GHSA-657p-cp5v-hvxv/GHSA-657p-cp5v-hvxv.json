  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm: zswap: fix shrinker NULL crash with cgroup_disable=memory\n\nChristian reports a NULL deref in zswap that he bisected down to the zswap\nshrinker.  The issue also cropped up in the bug trackers of libguestfs [1]\nand the Red Hat bugzilla [2].\n\nThe problem is that when memcg is disabled with the boot time flag, the\nzswap shrinker might get called with sc->memcg == NULL.  This is okay in\nmany places, like the lruvec operations.  But it crashes in\nmemcg_page_state() - which is only used due to the non-node accounting of\ncgroup's the zswap memory to begin with.\n\nNhat spotted that the memcg can be NULL in the memcg-disabled case, and I\nwas then able to reproduce the crash locally as well.\n\n[1] https://github.com/libguestfs/libguestfs/issues/139\n[2] https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2275252",
