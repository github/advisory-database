  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niommu/vt-d: Fix NULL domain on device release\n\nIn the kdump kernel, the IOMMU operates in deferred_attach mode. In this\nmode, info->domain may not yet be assigned by the time the release_device\nfunction is called. It leads to the following crash in the crash kernel:\n\n    BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 000000000000003c\n    ...\n    RIP: 0010:do_raw_spin_lock+0xa/0xa0\n    ...\n    _raw_spin_lock_irqsave+0x1b/0x30\n    intel_iommu_release_device+0x96/0x170\n    iommu_deinit_device+0x39/0xf0\n    __iommu_group_remove_device+0xa0/0xd0\n    iommu_bus_notifier+0x55/0xb0\n    notifier_call_chain+0x5a/0xd0\n    blocking_notifier_call_chain+0x41/0x60\n    bus_notify+0x34/0x50\n    device_del+0x269/0x3d0\n    pci_remove_bus_device+0x77/0x100\n    p2sb_bar+0xae/0x1d0\n    ...\n    i801_probe+0x423/0x740\n\nUse the release_domain mechanism to fix it.
