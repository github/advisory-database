  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nio_uring: fix io_queue_proc modifying req->flags\n\nWith multiple poll entries __io_queue_proc() might be running in\nparallel with poll handlers and possibly task_work, we should not be\ncarelessly modifying req->flags there. io_poll_double_prepare() handles\na similar case with locking but it's much easier to move it into\n__io_arm_poll_handler().",
