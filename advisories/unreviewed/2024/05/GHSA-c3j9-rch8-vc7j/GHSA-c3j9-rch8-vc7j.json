  "details": "Triangle MicroWorks SCADA Data Gateway Workspace Unrestricted Upload Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to upload arbitrary files on affected installations of Triangle MicroWorks SCADA Data Gateway. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the processing of workspace files.
