  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncan: mcba_usb: fix memory leak in mcba_usb\n\nSyzbot reported memory leak in SocketCAN driver for Microchip CAN BUS\nAnalyzer Tool. The problem was in unfreed usb_coherent.\n\nIn mcba_usb_start() 20 coherent buffers are allocated and there is\nnothing, that frees them:\n\n1) In callback function the urb is resubmitted and that's all\n2) In disconnect function urbs are simply killed, but URB_FREE_BUFFER\n   is not set (see mcba_usb_start) and this flag cannot be used with\n   coherent buffers.\n\nFail log:\n| [ 1354.053291][ T8413] mcba_usb 1-1:0.0 can0: device disconnected\n| [ 1367.059384][ T8420] kmemleak: 20 new suspected memory leaks (see /sys/kernel/debug/kmem)\n\nSo, all allocated buffers should be freed with usb_free_coherent()\nexplicitly\n\nNOTE:\nThe same pattern for allocating and freeing coherent buffers\nis used in drivers/net/can/usb/kvaser_usb/kvaser_usb_core.c",
