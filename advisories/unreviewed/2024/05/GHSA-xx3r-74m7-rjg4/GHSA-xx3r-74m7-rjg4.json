  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmd/dm-raid: don't call md_reap_sync_thread() directly\n\nCurrently md_reap_sync_thread() is called from raid_message() directly\nwithout holding 'reconfig_mutex', this is definitely unsafe because\nmd_reap_sync_thread() can change many fields that is protected by\n'reconfig_mutex'.\n\nHowever, hold 'reconfig_mutex' here is still problematic because this\nwill cause deadlock, for example, commit 130443d60b1b (\"md: refactor\nidle/frozen_sync_thread() to fix deadlock\").\n\nFix this problem by using stop_sync_thread() to unregister sync_thread,\nlike md/raid did.",
