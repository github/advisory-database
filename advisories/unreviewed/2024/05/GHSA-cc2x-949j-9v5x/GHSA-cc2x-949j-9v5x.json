  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amd/pm: Update intermediate power state for SI\n\nUpdate the current state as boot state during dpm initialization.\nDuring the subsequent initialization, set_power_state gets called to\ntransition to the final power state. set_power_state refers to values\nfrom the current state and without current state populated, it could\nresult in NULL pointer dereference.\n\nFor ex: on platforms where PCI speed change is supported through ACPI\nATCS method, the link speed of current state needs to be queried before\ndeciding on changing to final power state's link speed. The logic to query\nATCS-support was broken on certain platforms. The issue became visible\nwhen broken ATCS-support logic got fixed with commit\nf9b7f3703ff9 (\"drm/amdgpu/acpi: make ATPX/ATCS structures global (v2)\").\n\nBug: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/amd/-/issues/1698",
