  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nblk-mq: make sure active queue usage is held for bio_integrity_prep()\n\nblk_integrity_unregister() can come if queue usage counter isn't held\nfor one bio with integrity prepared, so this request may be completed with\ncalling profile->complete_fn, then kernel panic.\n\nAnother constraint is that bio_integrity_prep() needs to be called\nbefore bio merge.\n\nFix the issue by:\n\n- call bio_integrity_prep() with one queue usage counter grabbed reliably\n\n- call bio_integrity_prep() before bio merge",
