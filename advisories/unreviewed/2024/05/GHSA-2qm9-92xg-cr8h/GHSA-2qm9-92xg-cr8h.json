  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: imon: fix access to invalid resource for the second interface\n\nimon driver probes two USB interfaces, and at the probe of the second\ninterface, the driver assumes blindly that the first interface got\nbound with the same imon driver.  It's usually true, but it's still\npossible that the first interface is bound with another driver via a\nmalformed descriptor.  Then it may lead to a memory corruption, as\nspotted by syzkaller; imon driver accesses the data from drvdata as\nstruct imon_context object although it's a completely different one\nthat was assigned by another driver.\n\nThis patch adds a sanity check -- whether the first interface is\nreally bound with the imon driver or not -- for avoiding the problem\nabove at the probe time.",
