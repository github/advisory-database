  "details": "The Virtue theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via a Post Author's name in all versions up to, and including, 3.4.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping when the latest posts feature is enabled on the homepage. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
