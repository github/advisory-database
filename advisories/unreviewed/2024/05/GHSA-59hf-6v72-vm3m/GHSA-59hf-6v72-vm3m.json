  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: ks8851: Handle softirqs at the end of IRQ thread to fix hang\n\nThe ks8851_irq() thread may call ks8851_rx_pkts() in case there are\nany packets in the MAC FIFO, which calls netif_rx(). This netif_rx()\nimplementation is guarded by local_bh_disable() and local_bh_enable().\nThe local_bh_enable() may call do_softirq() to run softirqs in case\nany are pending. One of the softirqs is net_rx_action, which ultimately\nreaches the driver .start_xmit callback. If that happens, the system\nhangs. The entire call chain is below:\n\nks8851_start_xmit_par from netdev_start_xmit\nnetdev_start_xmit from dev_hard_start_xmit\ndev_hard_start_xmit from sch_direct_xmit\nsch_direct_xmit from __dev_queue_xmit\n__dev_queue_xmit from __neigh_update\n__neigh_update from neigh_update\nneigh_update from arp_process.constprop.0\narp_process.constprop.0 from __netif_receive_skb_one_core\n__netif_receive_skb_one_core from process_backlog\nprocess_backlog from __napi_poll.constprop.0\n__napi_poll.constprop.0 from net_rx_action\nnet_rx_action from __do_softirq\n__do_softirq from call_with_stack\ncall_with_stack from do_softirq\ndo_softirq from __local_bh_enable_ip\n__local_bh_enable_ip from netif_rx\nnetif_rx from ks8851_irq\nks8851_irq from irq_thread_fn\nirq_thread_fn from irq_thread\nirq_thread from kthread\nkthread from ret_from_fork\n\nThe hang happens because ks8851_irq() first locks a spinlock in\nks8851_par.c ks8851_lock_par() spin_lock_irqsave(&ksp->lock, ...)\nand with that spinlock locked, calls netif_rx(). Once the execution\nreaches ks8851_start_xmit_par(), it calls ks8851_lock_par() again\nwhich attempts to claim the already locked spinlock again, and the\nhang happens.\n\nMove the do_softirq() call outside of the spinlock protected section\nof ks8851_irq() by disabling BHs around the entire spinlock protected\nsection of ks8851_irq() handler. Place local_bh_enable() outside of\nthe spinlock protected section, so that it can trigger do_softirq()\nwithout the ks8851_par.c ks8851_lock_par() spinlock being held, and\nsafely call ks8851_start_xmit_par() without attempting to lock the\nalready locked spinlock.\n\nSince ks8851_irq() is protected by local_bh_disable()/local_bh_enable()\nnow, replace netif_rx() with __netif_rx() which is not duplicating the\nlocal_bh_disable()/local_bh_enable() calls.",
