  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ninterconnect: Don't access req_list while it's being manipulated\n\nThe icc_lock mutex was split into separate icc_lock and icc_bw_lock\nmutexes in [1] to avoid lockdep splats. However, this didn't adequately\nprotect access to icc_node::req_list.\n\nThe icc_set_bw() function will eventually iterate over req_list while\nonly holding icc_bw_lock, but req_list can be modified while only\nholding icc_lock. This causes races between icc_set_bw(), of_icc_get(),\nand icc_put().\n\nExample A:\n\n  CPU0                               CPU1\n  ----                               ----\n  icc_set_bw(path_a)\n    mutex_lock(&icc_bw_lock);\n                                     icc_put(path_b)\n                                       mutex_lock(&icc_lock);\n    aggregate_requests()\n      hlist_for_each_entry(r, ...\n                                       hlist_del(...\n        <r = invalid pointer>\n\nExample B:\n\n  CPU0                               CPU1\n  ----                               ----\n  icc_set_bw(path_a)\n    mutex_lock(&icc_bw_lock);\n                                     path_b = of_icc_get()\n                                       of_icc_get_by_index()\n                                         mutex_lock(&icc_lock);\n                                         path_find()\n                                           path_init()\n    aggregate_requests()\n      hlist_for_each_entry(r, ...\n                                             hlist_add_head(...\n        <r = invalid pointer>\n\nFix this by ensuring icc_bw_lock is always held before manipulating\nicc_node::req_list. The additional places icc_bw_lock is held don't\nperform any memory allocations, so we should still be safe from the\noriginal lockdep splats that motivated the separate locks.\n\n[1] commit af42269c3523 (\"interconnect: Fix locking for runpm vs reclaim\")",
