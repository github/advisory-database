  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nspi: bcm2835: Fix out-of-bounds access with more than 4 slaves\n\nCommit 571e31fa60b3 (\"spi: bcm2835: Cache CS register value for\n->prepare_message()\") limited the number of slaves to 3 at compile-time.\nThe limitation was necessitated by a statically-sized array prepare_cs[]\nin the driver private data which contains a per-slave register value.\n\nThe commit sought to enforce the limitation at run-time by setting the\ncontroller's num_chipselect to 3:  Slaves with a higher chipselect are\nrejected by spi_add_device().\n\nHowever the commit neglected that num_chipselect only limits the number\nof *native* chipselects.  If GPIO chipselects are specified in the\ndevice tree for more than 3 slaves, num_chipselect is silently raised by\nof_spi_get_gpio_numbers() and the result are out-of-bounds accesses to\nthe statically-sized array prepare_cs[].\n\nAs a bandaid fix which is backportable to stable, raise the number of\nallowed slaves to 24 (which \"ought to be enough for anybody\"), enforce\nthe limitation on slave ->setup and revert num_chipselect to 3 (which is\nthe number of native chipselects supported by the controller).\nAn upcoming for-next commit will allow an arbitrary number of slaves.",
