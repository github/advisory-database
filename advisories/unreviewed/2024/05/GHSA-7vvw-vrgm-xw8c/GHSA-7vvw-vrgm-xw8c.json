  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nASoC: SOF: ipc4-pcm: Workaround for crashed firmware on system suspend\n\nWhen the system is suspended while audio is active, the\nsof_ipc4_pcm_hw_free() is invoked to reset the pipelines since during\nsuspend the DSP is turned off, streams will be re-started after resume.\n\nIf the firmware crashes during while audio is running (or when we reset\nthe stream before suspend) then the sof_ipc4_set_multi_pipeline_state()\nwill fail with IPC error and the state change is interrupted.\nThis will cause misalignment between the kernel and firmware state on next\nDSP boot resulting errors returned by firmware for IPC messages, eventually\nfailing the audio resume.\nOn stream close the errors are ignored so the kernel state will be\ncorrected on the next DSP boot, so the second boot after the DSP panic.\n\nIf sof_ipc4_trigger_pipelines() is called from sof_ipc4_pcm_hw_free() then\nstate parameter is SOF_IPC4_PIPE_RESET and only in this case.\n\nTreat a forced pipeline reset similarly to how we treat a pcm_free by\nignoring error on state sending to allow the kernel's state to be\nconsistent with the state the firmware will have after the next boot.",
