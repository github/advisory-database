  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nio_uring: clear opcode specific data for an early failure\n\nIf failure happens before the opcode prep handler is called, ensure that\nwe clear the opcode specific area of the request, which holds data\nspecific to that request type. This prevents errors where opcode\nhandlers either don't get to clear per-request private data since prep\nisn't even called.",
