  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nleds: trigger: netdev: Fix kernel panic on interface rename trig notify\n\nCommit d5e01266e7f5 (\"leds: trigger: netdev: add additional specific link\nspeed mode\") in the various changes, reworked the way to set the LINKUP\nmode in commit cee4bd16c319 (\"leds: trigger: netdev: Recheck\nNETDEV_LED_MODE_LINKUP on dev rename\") and moved it to a generic function.\n\nThis changed the logic where, in the previous implementation the dev\nfrom the trigger event was used to check if the carrier was ok, but in\nthe new implementation with the generic function, the dev in\ntrigger_data is used instead.\n\nThis is problematic and cause a possible kernel panic due to the fact\nthat the dev in the trigger_data still reference the old one as the\nnew one (passed from the trigger event) still has to be hold and saved\nin the trigger_data struct (done in the NETDEV_REGISTER case).\n\nOn calling of get_device_state(), an invalid net_dev is used and this\ncause a kernel panic.\n\nTo handle this correctly, move the call to get_device_state() after the\nnew net_dev is correctly set in trigger_data (in the NETDEV_REGISTER\ncase) and correctly parse the new dev.",
