  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nPCI/PM: Drain runtime-idle callbacks before driver removal\n\nA race condition between the .runtime_idle() callback and the .remove()\ncallback in the rtsx_pcr PCI driver leads to a kernel crash due to an\nunhandled page fault [1].\n\nThe problem is that rtsx_pci_runtime_idle() is not expected to be running\nafter pm_runtime_get_sync() has been called, but the latter doesn't really\nguarantee that.  It only guarantees that the suspend and resume callbacks\nwill not be running when it returns.\n\nHowever, if a .runtime_idle() callback is already running when\npm_runtime_get_sync() is called, the latter will notice that the runtime PM\nstatus of the device is RPM_ACTIVE and it will return right away without\nwaiting for the former to complete.  In fact, it cannot wait for\n.runtime_idle() to complete because it may be called from that callback (it\narguably does not make much sense to do that, but it is not strictly\nprohibited).\n\nThus in general, whoever is providing a .runtime_idle() callback needs\nto protect it from running in parallel with whatever code runs after\npm_runtime_get_sync().  [Note that .runtime_idle() will not start after\npm_runtime_get_sync() has returned, but it may continue running then if it\nhas started earlier.]\n\nOne way to address that race condition is to call pm_runtime_barrier()\nafter pm_runtime_get_sync() (not before it, because a nonzero value of the\nruntime PM usage counter is necessary to prevent runtime PM callbacks from\nbeing invoked) to wait for the .runtime_idle() callback to complete should\nit be running at that point.  A suitable place for doing that is in\npci_device_remove() which calls pm_runtime_get_sync() before removing the\ndriver, so it may as well call pm_runtime_barrier() subsequently, which\nwill prevent the race in question from occurring, not just in the rtsx_pcr\ndriver, but in any PCI drivers providing .runtime_idle() callbacks.",
