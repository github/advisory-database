  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ngfs2: Fix slab-use-after-free in gfs2_qd_dealloc\n\nIn gfs2_put_super(), whether withdrawn or not, the quota should\nbe cleaned up by gfs2_quota_cleanup().\n\nOtherwise, struct gfs2_sbd will be freed before gfs2_qd_dealloc (rcu\ncallback) has run for all gfs2_quota_data objects, resulting in\nuse-after-free.\n\nAlso, gfs2_destroy_threads() and gfs2_quota_cleanup() is already called\nby gfs2_make_fs_ro(), so in gfs2_put_super(), after calling\ngfs2_make_fs_ro(), there is no need to call them again.",
