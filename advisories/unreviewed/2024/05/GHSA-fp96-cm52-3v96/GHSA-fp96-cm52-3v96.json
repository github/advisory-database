  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nidpf: fix kernel panic on unknown packet types\n\nIn the very rare case where a packet type is unknown to the driver,\nidpf_rx_process_skb_fields would return early without calling\neth_type_trans to set the skb protocol / the network layer handler.\nThis is especially problematic if tcpdump is running when such a\npacket is received, i.e. it would cause a kernel panic.\n\nInstead, call eth_type_trans for every single packet, even when\nthe packet type is unknown.",
