  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetfilter: nf_tables: Fix dereference of null pointer flow\n\nIn the case where chain->flags & NFT_CHAIN_HW_OFFLOAD is false then\nnft_flow_rule_create is not called and flow is NULL. The subsequent\nerror handling execution via label err_destroy_flow_rule will lead\nto a null pointer dereference on flow when calling nft_flow_rule_destroy.\nSince the error path to err_destroy_flow_rule has to cater for null\nand non-null flows, only call nft_flow_rule_destroy if flow is non-null\nto fix this issue.\n\nAddresses-Coverity: (\"Explicity null dereference\")",
