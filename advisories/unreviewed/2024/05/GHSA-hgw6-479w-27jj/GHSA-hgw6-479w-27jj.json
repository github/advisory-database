  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/mlx5: Properly link new fs rules into the tree\n\nPreviously, add_rule_fg would only add newly created rules from the\nhandle into the tree when they had a refcount of 1. On the other hand,\ncreate_flow_handle tries hard to find and reference already existing\nidentical rules instead of creating new ones.\n\nThese two behaviors can result in a situation where create_flow_handle\n1) creates a new rule and references it, then\n2) in a subsequent step during the same handle creation references it\n   again,\nresulting in a rule with a refcount of 2 that is not linked into the\ntree, will have a NULL parent and root and will result in a crash when\nthe flow group is deleted because del_sw_hw_rule, invoked on rule\ndeletion, assumes node->parent is != NULL.\n\nThis happened in the wild, due to another bug related to incorrect\nhandling of duplicate pkt_reformat ids, which lead to the code in\ncreate_flow_handle incorrectly referencing a just-added rule in the same\nflow handle, resulting in the problem described above. Full details are\nat [1].\n\nThis patch changes add_rule_fg to add new rules without parents into\nthe tree, properly initializing them and avoiding the crash. This makes\nit more consistent with how rules are added to an FTE in\ncreate_flow_handle.",
