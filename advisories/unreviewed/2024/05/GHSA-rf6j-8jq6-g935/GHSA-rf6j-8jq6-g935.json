  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncrypto: sun8i-ce - Fix use after free in unprepare\n\nsun8i_ce_cipher_unprepare should be called before\ncrypto_finalize_skcipher_request, because client callbacks may\nimmediately free memory, that isn't needed anymore. But it will be\nused by unprepare after free.
