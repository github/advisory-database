  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nUSB: core: Fix deadlock in port \"disable\" sysfs attribute\n\nThe show and store callback routines for the \"disable\" sysfs attribute\nfile in port.c acquire the device lock for the port's parent hub\ndevice.  This can cause problems if another process has locked the hub\nto remove it or change its configuration:\n\n\tRemoving the hub or changing its configuration requires the\n\thub interface to be removed, which requires the port device\n\tto be removed, and device_del() waits until all outstanding\n\tsysfs attribute callbacks for the ports have returned.  The\n\tlock can't be released until then.\n\n\tBut the disable_show() or disable_store() routine can't return\n\tuntil after it has acquired the lock.\n\nThe resulting deadlock can be avoided by calling\nsysfs_break_active_protection().  This will cause the sysfs core not\nto wait for the attribute's callback routine to return, allowing the\nremoval to proceed.  The disadvantage is that after making this call,\nthere is no guarantee that the hub structure won't be deallocated at\nany moment.  To prevent this, we have to acquire a reference to it\nfirst by calling hub_get().",
