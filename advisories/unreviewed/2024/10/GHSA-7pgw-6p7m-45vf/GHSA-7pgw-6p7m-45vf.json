  "details": "A vulnerability in the Cisco AnyConnect VPN server of Cisco Meraki MX and Cisco Meraki Z Series Teleworker Gateway devices could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a DoS condition in the AnyConnect service on an affected device.\n\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient resource management when establishing TLS/SSL sessions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of crafted TLS/SSL messages to the VPN server of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Cisco AnyConnect VPN server to stop accepting new connections, preventing new SSL VPN connections from being established. Existing SSL VPN sessions are not impacted.\nNote: When the attack traffic stops, the Cisco AnyConnect VPN server recovers gracefully without requiring manual intervention.",
