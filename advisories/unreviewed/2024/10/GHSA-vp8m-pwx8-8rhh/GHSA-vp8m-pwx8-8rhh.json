  "details": "A vulnerability in the restricted shell of Cisco Expressway Series could allow an authenticated, local attacker to perform command injection attacks on the underlying operating system and elevate privileges to root. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have Administrator-level credentials with read-write privileges on an affected device.\n\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a series of crafted CLI commands. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to escape the restricted shell and gain root privileges on the underlying operating system of the affected device.\nNote: Cisco Expressway Series refers to Cisco Expressway Control (Expressway-C) devices and Cisco Expressway Edge (Expressway-E) devices.",
