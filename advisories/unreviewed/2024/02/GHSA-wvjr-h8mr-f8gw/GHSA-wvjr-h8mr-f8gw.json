  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Defer the free of inner map when necessary\n\nWhen updating or deleting an inner map in map array or map htab, the map\nmay still be accessed by non-sleepable program or sleepable program.\nHowever bpf_map_fd_put_ptr() decreases the ref-counter of the inner map\ndirectly through bpf_map_put(), if the ref-counter is the last one\n(which is true for most cases), the inner map will be freed by\nops->map_free() in a kworker. But for now, most .map_free() callbacks\ndon't use synchronize_rcu() or its variants to wait for the elapse of a\nRCU grace period, so after the invocation of ops->map_free completes,\nthe bpf program which is accessing the inner map may incur\nuse-after-free problem.\n\nFix the free of inner map by invoking bpf_map_free_deferred() after both\none RCU grace period and one tasks trace RCU grace period if the inner\nmap has been removed from the outer map before. The deferment is\naccomplished by using call_rcu() or call_rcu_tasks_trace() when\nreleasing the last ref-counter of bpf map. The newly-added rcu_head\nfield in bpf_map shares the same storage space with work field to\nreduce the size of bpf_map.",
