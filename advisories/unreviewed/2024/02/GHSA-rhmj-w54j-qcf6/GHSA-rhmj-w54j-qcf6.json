However the function uses per-task\ncounters to track the number of inflight requests, so it counts more\nrequests than available via currect io_uring ctx and goes to sleep for\nthem to appear (e.g. from IRQ), that will never happen.\n\nCancel a bit more than before, i.e. all ctxs that share sqpoll\nand continue to use shared counters. Don't forget that we should not\nremove ctx from the list before running that task_work sqpoll-cancel,\notherwise the function wouldn't be able to find the context and will\nhang.",
