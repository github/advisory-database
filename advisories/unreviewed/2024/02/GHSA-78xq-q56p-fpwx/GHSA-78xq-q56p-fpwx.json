  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Fix masking negation logic upon negative dst register\n\nThe negation logic for the case where the off_reg is sitting in the\ndst register is not correct given then we cannot just invert the add\nto a sub or vice versa. As a fix, perform the final bitwise and-op\nunconditionally into AX from the off_reg, then move the pointer from\nthe src to dst and finally use AX as the source for the original\npointer arithmetic operation such that the inversion yields a correct\nresult. The single non-AX mov in between is possible given constant\nblinding is retaining it as it's not an immediate based operation.",
