To make\nsure all the CQEs will always come back so the refcount on the\nsmc_connection can always reach 0, smc_ib_modify_qp_reset() was replaced\nby smc_ib_modify_qp_error().\nAnd remove the timeout in smc_wr_tx_wait_no_pending_sends() since we\nneed to wait for all pending WQEs done, or we may encounter use-after-\nfree when handling CQEs.\n\nFor IB device removal routine, we need to wait for all the QPs on that\ndevice been destroyed before we can destroy CQs on the device, or\nthe refcount on smc_connection won't reach 0 and smc_sock cannot be\nreleased.",
