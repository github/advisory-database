  "details": "\nDell OS10 Networking Switches running 10.5.2.x and above contain a vulnerability with zeroMQ when VLT is configured. A remote unauthenticated attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability leading to information disclosure and a possible Denial of Service when a huge number of requests are sent to the switch. This is a high severity vulnerability as it allows an attacker to view sensitive data. Dell recommends customers to upgrade at the earliest opportunity.\n\n",
