  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nACPI: GTDT: Don't corrupt interrupt mappings on watchdow probe failure\n\nWhen failing the driver probe because of invalid firmware properties,\nthe GTDT driver unmaps the interrupt that it mapped earlier.\n\nHowever, it never checks whether the mapping of the interrupt actially\nsucceeded. Even more, should the firmware report an illegal interrupt\nnumber that overlaps with the GIC SGI range, this can result in an\nIPI being unmapped, and subsequent fireworks (as reported by Dann\nFrazier).\n\nRework the driver to have a slightly saner behaviour and actually\ncheck whether the interrupt has been mapped before unmapping things.",
