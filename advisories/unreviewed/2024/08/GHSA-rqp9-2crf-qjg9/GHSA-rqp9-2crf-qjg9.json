  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nlib: objagg: Fix general protection fault\n\nThe library supports aggregation of objects into other objects only if\nthe parent object does not have a parent itself. That is, nesting is not\nsupported.\n\nAggregation happens in two cases: Without and with hints, where hints\nare a pre-computed recommendation on how to aggregate the provided\nobjects.\n\nNesting is not possible in the first case due to a check that prevents\nit, but in the second case there is no check because the assumption is\nthat nesting cannot happen when creating objects based on hints. The\nviolation of this assumption leads to various warnings and eventually to\na general protection fault [1].\n\nBefore fixing the root cause, error out when nesting happens and warn.\n\n[1]\ngeneral protection fault, probably for non-canonical address 0xdead000000000d90: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP PTI\nCPU: 1 PID: 1083 Comm: kworker/1:9 Tainted: G        W          6.9.0-rc6-custom-gd9b4f1cca7fb #7\nHardware name: Mellanox Technologies Ltd.
