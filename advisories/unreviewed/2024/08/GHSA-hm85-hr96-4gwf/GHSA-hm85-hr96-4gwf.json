  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsched/core: Fix use-after-free bug in dup_user_cpus_ptr()\n\nSince commit 07ec77a1d4e8 (\"sched: Allow task CPU affinity to be\nrestricted on asymmetric systems\"), the setting and clearing of\nuser_cpus_ptr are done under pi_lock for arm64 architecture. However,\ndup_user_cpus_ptr() accesses user_cpus_ptr without any lock\nprotection. Since sched_setaffinity() can be invoked from another\nprocess, the process being modified may be undergoing fork() at\nthe same time.  When racing with the clearing of user_cpus_ptr in\n__set_cpus_allowed_ptr_locked(), it can lead to user-after-free and\npossibly double-free in arm64 kernel.\n\nCommit 8f9ea86fdf99 (\"sched: Always preserve the user requested\ncpumask\") fixes this problem as user_cpus_ptr, once set, will never\nbe cleared in a task's lifetime. However, this bug was re-introduced\nin commit 851a723e45d1 (\"sched: Always clear user_cpus_ptr in\ndo_set_cpus_allowed()\") which allows the clearing of user_cpus_ptr in\ndo_set_cpus_allowed(). This time, it will affect all arches.\n\nFix this bug by always clearing the user_cpus_ptr of the newly\ncloned/forked task before the copying process starts and check the\nuser_cpus_ptr state of the source task under pi_lock.\n\nNote to stable, this patch won't be applicable to stable releases.\nJust copy the new dup_user_cpus_ptr() function over.",
