  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndm-raid: Fix WARN_ON_ONCE check for sync_thread in raid_resume\n\nrm-raid devices will occasionally trigger the following warning when\nbeing resumed after a table load because DM_RECOVERY_RUNNING is set:\n\nWARNING: CPU: 7 PID: 5660 at drivers/md/dm-raid.c:4105 raid_resume+0xee/0x100 [dm_raid]\n\nThe failing check is:\nWARN_ON_ONCE(test_bit(MD_RECOVERY_RUNNING, &mddev->recovery));\n\nThis check is designed to make sure that the sync thread isn't\nregistered, but md_check_recovery can set MD_RECOVERY_RUNNING without\nthe sync_thread ever getting registered. Instead of checking if\nMD_RECOVERY_RUNNING is set, check if sync_thread is non-NULL.",
