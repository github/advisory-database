  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: venus: fix use after free in vdec_close\n\nThere appears to be a possible use after free with vdec_close().\nThe firmware will add buffer release work to the work queue through\nHFI callbacks as a normal part of decoding. Randomly closing the\ndecoder device from userspace during normal decoding can incur\na read after free for inst.\n\nFix it by cancelling the work in vdec_close.",
