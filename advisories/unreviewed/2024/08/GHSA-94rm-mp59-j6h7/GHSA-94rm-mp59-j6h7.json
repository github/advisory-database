  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niio: Fix the sorting functionality in iio_gts_build_avail_time_table\n\nThe sorting in iio_gts_build_avail_time_table is not working as intended.\nIt could result in an out-of-bounds access when the time is zero.\n\nHere are more details:\n\n1. When the gts->itime_table[i].time_us is zero, e.g., the time\nsequence is `3, 0, 1`, the inner for-loop will not terminate and do\nout-of-bound writes. This is because once `times[j] > new`, the value\n`new` will be added in the current position and the `times[j]` will be\nmoved to `j+1` position, which makes the if-condition always hold.\nMeanwhile, idx will be added one, making the loop keep running without\ntermination and out-of-bound write.\n2. If none of the gts->itime_table[i].time_us is zero, the elements\nwill just be copied without being sorted as described in the comment\n\"Sort times from all tables to one and remove duplicates\".\n\nFor more details, please refer to\nhttps://lore.kernel.org/all/6dd0d822-046c-4dd2-9532-79d7ab96ec05@gmail.com.",
