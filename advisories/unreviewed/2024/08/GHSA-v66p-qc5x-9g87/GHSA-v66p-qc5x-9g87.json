This issue allows an attacker to replace their real IP address with any arbitrary IP address, specifically by adding a forged 'X-Forwarded' or 'Client-IP' header to requests. Exploiting IP spoofing, attackers can bypass account lockout mechanisms during attempts to log into admin accounts, spoof IP addresses in requests sent to the server, and impersonate IP addresses that have logged into user accounts, etc.",
