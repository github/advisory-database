  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nlandlock: Don't lose track of restrictions on cred_transfer\n\nWhen a process' cred struct is replaced, this _almost_ always invokes\nthe cred_prepare LSM hook; but in one special case (when\nKEYCTL_SESSION_TO_PARENT updates the parent's credentials), the\ncred_transfer LSM hook is used instead.  Landlock only implements the\ncred_prepare hook, not cred_transfer, so KEYCTL_SESSION_TO_PARENT causes\nall information on Landlock restrictions to be lost.\n\nThis basically means that a process with the ability to use the fork()\nand keyctl() syscalls can get rid of all Landlock restrictions on\nitself.\n\nFix it by adding a cred_transfer hook that does the same thing as the\nexisting cred_prepare hook. (Implemented by having hook_cred_prepare()\ncall hook_cred_transfer() so that the two functions are less likely to\naccidentally diverge in the future.)",
