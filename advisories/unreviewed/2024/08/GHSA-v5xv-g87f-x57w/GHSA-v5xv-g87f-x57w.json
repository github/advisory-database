  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nKVM: x86/mmu: make apf token non-zero to fix bug\n\nIn current async pagefault logic, when a page is ready, KVM relies on\nkvm_arch_can_dequeue_async_page_present() to determine whether to deliver\na READY event to the Guest. This function test token value of struct\nkvm_vcpu_pv_apf_data, which must be reset to zero by Guest kernel when a\nREADY event is finished by Guest. If value is zero meaning that a READY\nevent is done, so the KVM can deliver another.\nBut the kvm_arch_setup_async_pf() may produce a valid token with zero\nvalue, which is confused with previous mention and may lead the loss of\nthis READY event.\n\nThis bug may cause task blocked forever in Guest:\n INFO: task stress:7532 blocked for more than 1254 seconds.\n       Not tainted 5.10.0 #16\n \"echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/hung_task_timeout_secs\" disables this message.\n task:stress          state:D stack:    0 pid: 7532 ppid:  1409\n flags:0x00000080\n Call Trace:\n  __schedule+0x1e7/0x650\n  schedule+0x46/0xb0\n  kvm_async_pf_task_wait_schedule+0xad/0xe0\n  ? exit_to_user_mode_prepare+0x60/0x70\n  __kvm_handle_async_pf+0x4f/0xb0\n  ? asm_exc_page_fault+0x8/0x30\n  exc_page_fault+0x6f/0x110\n  ? asm_exc_page_fault+0x8/0x30\n  asm_exc_page_fault+0x1e/0x30\n RIP: 0033:0x402d00\n RSP: 002b:00007ffd31912500 EFLAGS: 00010206\n RAX: 0000000000071000 RBX: ffffffffffffffff RCX: 00000000021a32b0\n RDX: 000000000007d011 RSI: 000000000007d000 RDI: 00000000021262b0\n RBP: 00000000021262b0 R08: 0000000000000003 R09: 0000000000000086\n R10: 00000000000000eb R11: 00007fefbdf2baa0 R12: 0000000000000000\n R13: 0000000000000002 R14: 000000000007d000 R15: 0000000000001000",
