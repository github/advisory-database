  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niommu/arm-smmu-v3: Don't unregister on shutdown\n\nSimilar to SMMUv2, this driver calls iommu_device_unregister() from the\nshutdown path, which removes the IOMMU groups with no coordination\nwhatsoever with their users - shutdown methods are optional in device\ndrivers. This can lead to NULL pointer dereferences in those drivers'\nDMA API calls, or worse.\n\nInstead of calling the full arm_smmu_device_remove() from\narm_smmu_device_shutdown(), let's pick only the relevant function call -\narm_smmu_device_disable() - more or less the reverse of\narm_smmu_device_reset() - and call just that from the shutdown path.",
