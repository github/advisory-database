  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ngpio: prevent potential speculation leaks in gpio_device_get_desc()\n\nUserspace may trigger a speculative read of an address outside the gpio\ndescriptor array.\nUsers can do that by calling gpio_ioctl() with an offset out of range.\nOffset is copied from user and then used as an array index to get\nthe gpio descriptor without sanitization in gpio_device_get_desc().\n\nThis change ensures that the offset is sanitized by using\narray_index_nospec() to mitigate any possibility of speculative\ninformation leaks.\n\nThis bug was discovered and resolved using Coverity Static Analysis\nSecurity Testing (SAST) by Synopsys, Inc.",
