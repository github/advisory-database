  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: fix memory ordering between normal and ordered work functions\n\nOrdered work functions aren't guaranteed to be handled by the same thread\nwhich executed the normal work functions. The only way execution between\nnormal/ordered functions is synchronized is via the WORK_DONE_BIT,\nunfortunately the used bitops don't guarantee any ordering whatsoever.\n\nThis manifested as seemingly inexplicable crashes on ARM64, where\nasync_chunk::inode is seen as non-null in async_cow_submit which causes\nsubmit_compressed_extents to be called and crash occurs because\nasync_chunk::inode suddenly became NULL. The call trace was similar to:\n\n    pc : submit_compressed_extents+0x38/0x3d0\n    lr : async_cow_submit+0x50/0xd0\n    sp : ffff800015d4bc20\n\n    <registers omitted for brevity>\n\n    Call trace:\n     submit_compressed_extents+0x38/0x3d0\n     async_cow_submit+0x50/0xd0\n     run_ordered_work+0xc8/0x280\n     btrfs_work_helper+0x98/0x250\n     process_one_work+0x1f0/0x4ac\n     worker_thread+0x188/0x504\n     kthread+0x110/0x114\n     ret_from_fork+0x10/0x18\n\nFix this by adding respective barrier calls which ensure that all\naccesses preceding setting of WORK_DONE_BIT are strictly ordered before\nsetting the flag. At the same time add a read barrier after reading of\nWORK_DONE_BIT in run_ordered_work which ensures all subsequent loads\nwould be strictly ordered after reading the bit. This in turn ensures\nare all accesses before WORK_DONE_BIT are going to be strictly ordered\nbefore any access that can occur in ordered_func.",
