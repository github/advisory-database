  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\naf_unix: Fix garbage collector racing against connect()\n\nGarbage collector does not take into account the risk of embryo getting\nenqueued during the garbage collection. If such embryo has a peer that\ncarries SCM_RIGHTS, two consecutive passes of scan_children() may see a\ndifferent set of children. Leading to an incorrectly elevated inflight\ncount, and then a dangling pointer within the gc_inflight_list.\n\nsockets are AF_UNIX/SOCK_STREAM\nS is an unconnected socket\nL is a listening in-flight socket bound to addr, not in fdtable\nV's fd will be passed via sendmsg(), gets inflight count bumped\n\nconnect(S, addr)\tsendmsg(S, [V]); close(V)\t__unix_gc()\n----------------\t-------------------------\t-----------\n\nNS = unix_create1()\nskb1 = sock_wmalloc(NS)\nL = unix_find_other(addr)\nunix_state_lock(L)\nunix_peer(S) = NS\n\t\t\t// V count=1 inflight=0\n\n \t\t\tNS = unix_peer(S)\n \t\t\tskb2 = sock_alloc()\n\t\t\tskb_queue_tail(NS, skb2[V])\n\n\t\t\t// V became in-flight\n\t\t\t// V count=2 inflight=1\n\n\t\t\tclose(V)\n\n\t\t\t// V count=1 inflight=1\n\t\t\t// GC candidate condition met\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor u in gc_inflight_list:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  if (total_refs == inflight_refs)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t    add u to gc_candidates\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t// gc_candidates={L, V}\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor u in gc_candidates:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  scan_children(u, dec_inflight)\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t// embryo (skb1) was not\n\t\t\t\t\t\t// reachable from L yet, so V's\n\t\t\t\t\t\t// inflight remains unchanged\n__skb_queue_tail(L, skb1)\nunix_state_unlock(L)\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor u in gc_candidates:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  if (u.inflight)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t    scan_children(u, inc_inflight_move_tail)\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t// V count=1 inflight=2 (!)\n\nIf there is a GC-candidate listening socket, lock/unlock its state. This\nmakes GC wait until the end of any ongoing connect() to that socket. After\nflipping the lock, a possibly SCM-laden embryo is already enqueued. And if\nthere is another embryo coming, it can not possibly carry SCM_RIGHTS. At\nthis point, unix_inflight() can not happen because unix_gc_lock is already\ntaken. Inflight graph remains unaffected.",
