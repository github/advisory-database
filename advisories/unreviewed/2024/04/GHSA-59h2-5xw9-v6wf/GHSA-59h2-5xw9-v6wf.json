  "details": "A vulnerability affects Brocade SANnav before v2.3.1 and v2.3.0a. It allows a Brocade SANnav service to send ping commands in the background at regular intervals to gridgain.com to check if updates are available for the Component. This could make an unauthenticated, remote attacker aware of the behavior and launch a supply-chain attack against a Brocade SANnav appliance.\n",
