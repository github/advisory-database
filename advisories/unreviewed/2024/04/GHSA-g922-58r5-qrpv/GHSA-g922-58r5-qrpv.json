  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nblk-iocost: Fix an UBSAN shift-out-of-bounds warning\n\nWhen iocg_kick_delay() is called from a CPU different than the one which set\nthe delay, @now may be in the past of @iocg->delay_at leading to the\nfollowing warning:\n\n  UBSAN: shift-out-of-bounds in block/blk-iocost.c:1359:23\n  shift exponent 18446744073709 is too large for 64-bit type 'u64' (aka 'unsigned long long')\n  ...\n  Call Trace:\n   <TASK>\n   dump_stack_lvl+0x79/0xc0\n   __ubsan_handle_shift_out_of_bounds+0x2ab/0x300\n   iocg_kick_delay+0x222/0x230\n   ioc_rqos_merge+0x1d7/0x2c0\n   __rq_qos_merge+0x2c/0x80\n   bio_attempt_back_merge+0x83/0x190\n   blk_attempt_plug_merge+0x101/0x150\n   blk_mq_submit_bio+0x2b1/0x720\n   submit_bio_noacct_nocheck+0x320/0x3e0\n   __swap_writepage+0x2ab/0x9d0\n\nThe underflow itself doesn't really affect the behavior in any meaningful\nway; however, the past timestamp may exaggerate the delay amount calculated\nlater in the code, which shouldn't be a material problem given the nature of\nthe delay mechanism.\n\nIf @now is in the past, this CPU is racing another CPU which recently set up\nthe delay and there's nothing this CPU can contribute w.r.t. the delay.\nLet's bail early from iocg_kick_delay() in such cases.",
