  "details": "The ShopLentor – WooCommerce Builder for Elementor & Gutenberg +10 Modules – All in One Solution (formerly WooLentor) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'wishsuite_button' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 2.8.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes like 'button_class'. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
