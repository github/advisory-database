  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncxl/pci: Skip to handle RAS errors if CXL.mem device is detached\n\nThe PCI AER model is an awkward fit for CXL error handling. While the\nexpectation is that a PCI device can escalate to link reset to recover\nfrom an AER event, the same reset on CXL amounts to a surprise memory\nhotplug of massive amounts of memory.\n\nAt present, the CXL error handler attempts some optimistic error\nhandling to unbind the device from the cxl_mem driver after reaping some\nRAS register values. This results in a \"hopeful\" attempt to unplug the\nmemory, but there is no guarantee that will succeed.\n\nA subsequent AER notification after the memdev unbind event can no\nlonger assume the registers are mapped. Check for memdev bind before\nreaping status register values to avoid crashes of the form:\n\n BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ffa00000195e9100\n #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode\n #PF: error_code(0x0000) - not-present page\n [...]\n RIP: 0010:__cxl_handle_ras+0x30/0x110 [cxl_core]\n [...]\n Call Trace:\n  <TASK>\n  ? __die+0x24/0x70\n  ? page_fault_oops+0x82/0x160\n  ? kernelmode_fixup_or_oops+0x84/0x110\n  ? exc_page_fault+0x113/0x170\n  ? asm_exc_page_fault+0x26/0x30\n  ? __pfx_dpc_reset_link+0x10/0x10\n  ? __cxl_handle_ras+0x30/0x110 [cxl_core]\n  ? find_cxl_port+0x59/0x80 [cxl_core]\n  cxl_handle_rp_ras+0xbc/0xd0 [cxl_core]\n  cxl_error_detected+0x6c/0xf0 [cxl_core]\n  report_error_detected+0xc7/0x1c0\n  pci_walk_bus+0x73/0x90\n  pcie_do_recovery+0x23f/0x330\n\nLonger term, the unbind and PCI_ERS_RESULT_DISCONNECT behavior might\nneed to be replaced with a new PCI_ERS_RESULT_PANIC.",
