  "details": "A Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in the IKE daemon (iked) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series with SPC3, and SRX Series allows an administratively adjacent attacker which is able to successfully establish IPsec tunnels to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\nIf specific values for the IPsec parameters local-ip, remote-ip, remote ike-id, and traffic selectors are sent from the peer, a memory leak occurs during every IPsec SA rekey which is carried out with a specific message sequence. This will eventually result in an iked process crash and restart.\n\nThe iked process memory consumption can be checked using the below command:\n  user@host> show system processes extensive | grep iked\n           PID   USERNAME     PRI  NICE    SIZE    RES    STATE    C   TIME  WCPU COMMAND\n           56903 root         31    0      4016M  2543M   CPU0     0   2:10  10.50% iked\n\nThis issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS:\n  *  All versions earlier than 20.4R3-S9;\n  *  21.2 versions earlier than 21.2R3-S7;\n  *  21.3 versions earlier than 21.3R3-S5;\n  *  21.4 versions earlier than 21.4R3-S4;\n  *  22.1 versions earlier than 22.1R3-S3;\n  *  22.2 versions earlier than 22.2R3-S2;\n  *  22.3 versions earlier than 22.3R3;\n  *  22.4 versions earlier than 22.4R3;\n  *  23.2 versions earlier than 23.2R1-S2, 23.2R2.\n\n\n",
