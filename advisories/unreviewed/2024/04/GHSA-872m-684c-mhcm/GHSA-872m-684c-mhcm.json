  "details": "The WPC Composite Products for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'wooco_components[0][name]' parameter in all versions up to, and including, 7.2.7 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping and missing authorization on the ajax_save_components function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
