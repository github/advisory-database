  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmd: Don't ignore read-only array in md_check_recovery()\n\nUsually if the array is not read-write, md_check_recovery() won't\nregister new sync_thread in the first place. And if the array is\nread-write and sync_thread is registered, md_set_readonly() will\nunregister sync_thread before setting the array read-only. md/raid\nfollow this behavior hence there is no problem.\n\nAfter commit f52f5c71f3d4 (\"md: fix stopping sync thread\"), following\nhang can be triggered by test shell/integrity-caching.sh:\n\n1) array is read-only. dm-raid update super block:\nrs_update_sbs\n ro = mddev->ro\n mddev->ro = 0\n  -> set array read-write\n md_update_sb\n\n2) register new sync thread concurrently.\n\n3) dm-raid set array back to read-only:\nrs_update_sbs\n mddev->ro = ro\n\n4) stop the array:\nraid_dtr\n md_stop\n  stop_sync_thread\n    set_bit(MD_RECOVERY_INTR, &mddev->recovery);\n    md_wakeup_thread_directly(mddev->sync_thread);\n    wait_event(..., !test_bit(MD_RECOVERY_RUNNING, &mddev->recovery))\n\n5) sync thread done:\n md_do_sync\n set_bit(MD_RECOVERY_DONE, &mddev->recovery);\n md_wakeup_thread(mddev->thread);\n\n6) daemon thread can't unregister sync thread:\n md_check_recovery\n  if (!md_is_rdwr(mddev) &&\n      !test_bit(MD_RECOVERY_NEEDED, &mddev->recovery))\n   return;\n  -> -> MD_RECOVERY_RUNNING can't be cleared, hence step 4 hang;\n\nThe root cause is that dm-raid manipulate 'mddev->ro' by itself,\nhowever, dm-raid really should stop sync thread before setting the\narray read-only. Unfortunately, I need to read more code before I\ncan refacter the handler of 'mddev->ro' in dm-raid, hence let's fix\nthe problem the easy way for now to prevent dm-raid regression.",
