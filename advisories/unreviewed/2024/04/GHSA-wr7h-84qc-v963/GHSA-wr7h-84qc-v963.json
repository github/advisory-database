  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/i915/dsc: Fix the macro that calculates DSCC_/DSCA_ PPS reg address\n\nCommit bd077259d0a9 (\"drm/i915/vdsc: Add function to read any PPS\nregister\") defines a new macro to calculate the DSC PPS register\naddresses with PPS number as an input. This macro correctly calculates\nthe addresses till PPS 11 since the addresses increment by 4. So in that\ncase the following macro works correctly to give correct register\naddress:\n\n_MMIO(_DSCA_PPS_0 + (pps) * 4)\n\nHowever after PPS 11, the register address for PPS 12 increments by 12\nbecause of RC Buffer memory allocation in between. Because of this\ndiscontinuity in the address space, the macro calculates wrong addresses\nfor PPS 12 - 16 resulting into incorrect DSC PPS parameter value\nread/writes causing DSC corruption.\n\nThis fixes it by correcting this macro to add the offset of 12 for PPS\n>=12.\n\nv3: Add correct paranthesis for pps argument (Jani Nikula)\n\n(cherry picked from commit 6074be620c31dc2ae11af96a1a5ea95580976fb5)",
