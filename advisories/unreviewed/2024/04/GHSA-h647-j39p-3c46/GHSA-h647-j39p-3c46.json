  "details": "A Improper Validation of Array Index issue affecting the v2_sdk_service running on a set of DJI drone devices on the port 10000 could allow an attacker to corrupt a controlled memory location due to a missing input validation in the on_receive_session_packet_ack function implemented in the libv2_sdk.so library used by the dji_vtwo_sdk binary implementing the service, potentially leading to a memory information leak or to an arbitrary code execution.
