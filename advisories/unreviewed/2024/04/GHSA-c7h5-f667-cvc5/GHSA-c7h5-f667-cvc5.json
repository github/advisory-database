  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\num: time-travel: fix time corruption\n\nIn 'basic' time-travel mode (without =inf-cpu or =ext), we\nstill get timer interrupts. These can happen at arbitrary\npoints in time, i.e. while in timer_read(), which pushes\ntime forward just a little bit. Then, if we happen to get\nthe interrupt after calculating the new time to push to,\nbut before actually finishing that, the interrupt will set\nthe time to a value that's incompatible with the forward,\nand we'll crash because time goes backwards when we do the\nforwarding.\n\nFix this by reading the time_travel_time, calculating the\nadjustment, and doing the adjustment all with interrupts\ndisabled.",
