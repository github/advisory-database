  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/mlx5e: Use a memory barrier to enforce PTP WQ xmit submission tracking occurs after populating the metadata_map\n\nJust simply reordering the functions mlx5e_ptp_metadata_map_put and\nmlx5e_ptpsq_track_metadata in the mlx5e_txwqe_complete context is not good\nenough since both the compiler and CPU are free to reorder these two\nfunctions. If reordering does occur, the issue that was supposedly fixed by\n7e3f3ba97e6c (\"net/mlx5e: Track xmit submission to PTP WQ after populating\nmetadata map\") will be seen. This will lead to NULL pointer dereferences in\nmlx5e_ptpsq_mark_ts_cqes_undelivered in the NAPI polling context due to the\ntracking list being populated before the metadata map.",
