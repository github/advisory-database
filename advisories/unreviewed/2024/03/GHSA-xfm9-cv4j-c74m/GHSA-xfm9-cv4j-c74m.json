  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/sparsemem: fix race in accessing memory_section->usage\n\nThe below race is observed on a PFN which falls into the device memory\nregion with the system memory configuration where PFN's are such that\n[ZONE_NORMAL ZONE_DEVICE ZONE_NORMAL].  Since normal zone start and end\npfn contains the device memory PFN's as well, the compaction triggered\nwill try on the device memory PFN's too though they end up in NOP(because\npfn_to_online_page() returns NULL for ZONE_DEVICE memory sections).  When\nfrom other core, the section mappings are being removed for the\nZONE_DEVICE region, that the PFN in question belongs to, on which\ncompaction is currently being operated is resulting into the kernel crash\nwith CONFIG_SPASEMEM_VMEMAP enabled.  The crash logs can be seen at [1].\n\ncompact_zone()\t\t\tmemunmap_pages\n-------------\t\t\t---------------\n__pageblock_pfn_to_page\n   ......\n (a)pfn_valid():\n     valid_section()//return true\n\t\t\t      (b)__remove_pages()->\n\t\t\t\t  sparse_remove_section()->\n\t\t\t\t    section_deactivate():\n\t\t\t\t    [Free the array ms->usage and set\n\t\t\t\t     ms->usage = NULL]\n     pfn_section_valid()\n     [Access ms->usage which\n     is NULL]\n\nNOTE: From the above it can be said that the race is reduced to between\nthe pfn_valid()/pfn_section_valid() and the section deactivate with\nSPASEMEM_VMEMAP enabled.\n\nThe commit b943f045a9af(\"mm/sparse: fix kernel crash with\npfn_section_valid check\") tried to address the same problem by clearing\nthe SECTION_HAS_MEM_MAP with the expectation of valid_section() returns\nfalse thus ms->usage is not accessed.\n\nFix this issue by the below steps:\n\na) Clear SECTION_HAS_MEM_MAP before freeing the ->usage.\n\nb) RCU protected read side critical section will either return NULL\n   when SECTION_HAS_MEM_MAP is cleared or can successfully access ->usage.\n\nc) Free the ->usage with kfree_rcu() and set ms->usage = NULL.  No\n   attempt will be made to access ->usage after this as the\n   SECTION_HAS_MEM_MAP is cleared thus valid_section() return false.\n\nThanks to David/Pavan for their inputs on this patch.\n\n[1] https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/994410bb-89aa-d987-1f50-f514903c55aa@quicinc.com/\n\nOn Snapdragon SoC, with the mentioned memory configuration of PFN's as\n[ZONE_NORMAL ZONE_DEVICE ZONE_NORMAL], we are able to see bunch of\nissues daily while testing on a device farm.\n\nFor this particular issue below is the log.  Though the below log is\nnot directly pointing to the pfn_section_valid(){ ms->usage;}, when we\nloaded this dump on T32 lauterbach tool, it is pointing.\n\n[  540.578056] Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at\nvirtual address 0000000000000000\n[  540.578068] Mem abort info:\n[  540.578070]   ESR = 0x0000000096000005\n[  540.578073]   EC = 0x25: DABT (current EL), IL = 32 bits\n[  540.578077]   SET = 0, FnV = 0\n[  540.578080]   EA = 0, S1PTW = 0\n[  540.578082]   FSC = 0x05: level 1 translation fault\n[  540.578085] Data abort info:\n[  540.578086]   ISV = 0, ISS = 0x00000005\n[  540.578088]   CM = 0, WnR = 0\n[  540.579431] pstate: 82400005 (Nzcv daif +PAN -UAO +TCO -DIT -SSBSBTYPE=--)\n[  540.579436] pc : __pageblock_pfn_to_page+0x6c/0x14c\n[  540.579454] lr : compact_zone+0x994/0x1058\n[  540.579460] sp : ffffffc03579b510\n[  540.579463] x29: ffffffc03579b510 x28: 0000000000235800 x27:000000000000000c\n[  540.579470] x26: 0000000000235c00 x25: 0000000000000068 x24:ffffffc03579b640\n[  540.579477] x23: 0000000000000001 x22: ffffffc03579b660 x21:0000000000000000\n[  540.579483] x20: 0000000000235bff x19: ffffffdebf7e3940 x18:ffffffdebf66d140\n[  540.579489] x17: 00000000739ba063 x16: 00000000739ba063 x15:00000000009f4bff\n[  540.579495] x14: 0000008000000000 x13: 0000000000000000 x12:0000000000000001\n[  540.579501] x11: 0000000000000000 x10: 0000000000000000 x9 :ffffff897d2cd440\n[  540.579507] x8 : 0000000000000000 x7 : 0000000000000000 x6 :ffffffc03579b5b4\n[  540.579512] x5 : 0000000000027f25 x4 : ffffffc03579b5b8 x3 :0000000000000\n---truncated---",
