Users are recommended to find an alternative or restrict access to the instance to trusted users. Alternatively, you could configure a HTTP proxy in front of your Archiva instance to only forward requests that do not have malicious characters in the URL.\n\nNOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer.\n\n",
