  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nx86/kvm: Teardown PV features on boot CPU as well\n\nVarious PV features (Async PF, PV EOI, steal time) work through memory\nshared with hypervisor and when we restore from hibernation we must\nproperly teardown all these features to make sure hypervisor doesn't\nwrite to stale locations after we jump to the previously hibernated kernel\n(which can try to place anything there). For secondary CPUs the job is\nalready done by kvm_cpu_down_prepare(), register syscore ops to do\nthe same for boot CPU.",
