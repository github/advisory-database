  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nNFSD: Fix READDIR buffer overflow\n\nIf a client sends a READDIR count argument that is too small (say,\nzero), then the buffer size calculation in the new init_dirlist\nhelper functions results in an underflow, allowing the XDR stream\nfunctions to write beyond the actual buffer.\n\nThis calculation has always been suspect. NFSD has never sanity-\nchecked the READDIR count argument, but the old entry encoders\nmanaged the problem correctly.\n\nWith the commits below, entry encoding changed, exposing the\nunderflow to the pointer arithmetic in xdr_reserve_space().\n\nModern NFS clients attempt to retrieve as much data as possible\nfor each READDIR request. Also, we have no unit tests that\nexercise the behavior of READDIR at the lower bound of @count\nvalues. Thus this case was missed during testing.",
