  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nxen-netback: take a reference to the RX task thread\n\nDo this in order to prevent the task from being freed if the thread\nreturns (which can be triggered by the frontend) before the call to\nkthread_stop done as part of the backend tear down. Not taking the\nreference will lead to a use-after-free in that scenario. Such\nreference was taken before but dropped as part of the rework done in\n2ac061ce97f4.\n\nReintroduce the reference taking and add a comment this time\nexplaining why it's needed.\n\nThis is XSA-374 / CVE-2021-28691.",
