  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niio: adc: ad7124: Fix potential overflow due to non sequential channel numbers\n\nChannel numbering must start at 0 and then not have any holes, or\nit is possible to overflow the available storage.  Note this bug was\nintroduced as part of a fix to ensure we didn't rely on the ordering\nof child nodes.  So we need to support arbitrary ordering but they all\nneed to be there somewhere.\n\nNote I hit this when using qemu to test the rest of this series.\nArguably this isn't the best fix, but it is probably the most minimal\noption for backporting etc.\n\nAlexandru's sign-off is here because he carried this patch in a larger\nset that Jonathan then applied.",
