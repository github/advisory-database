  "details": "The Video Conferencing with Zoom plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'zoom_recordings_by_meeting' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 4.4.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
