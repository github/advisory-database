  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/slab_common: fix slab_caches list corruption after kmem_cache_destroy()\n\nAfter the commit in Fixes:, if a module that created a slab cache does not\nrelease all of its allocated objects before destroying the cache (at rmmod\ntime), we might end up releasing the kmem_cache object without removing it\nfrom the slab_caches list thus corrupting the list as kmem_cache_destroy()\nignores the return value from shutdown_cache(), which in turn never removes\nthe kmem_cache object from slabs_list in case __kmem_cache_shutdown() fails\nto release all of the cache's slabs.\n\nThis is easily observable on a kernel built with CONFIG_DEBUG_LIST=y\nas after that ill release the system will immediately trip on list_add,\nor list_del, assertions similar to the one shown below as soon as another\nkmem_cache gets created, or destroyed:\n\n  [ 1041.213632] list_del corruption. next->prev should be ffff89f596fb5768, but was 52f1e5016aeee75d.
