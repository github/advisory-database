  "details": "A defect was discovered in the Python “ssl” module where there is a memory\nrace condition with the ssl.SSLContext methods “cert_store_stats()” and\n“get_ca_certs()”. The race condition can be triggered if the methods are\ncalled at the same time as certificates are loaded into the SSLContext,\nsuch as during the TLS handshake with a certificate directory configured.\nThis issue is fixed in CPython 3.10.14, 3.11.9, 3.12.3, and 3.13.0a5.",
