  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nepoll: be better about file lifetimes\n\nepoll can call out to vfs_poll() with a file pointer that may race with\nthe last 'fput()'. That would make f_count go down to zero, and while\nthe ep->mtx locking means that the resulting file pointer tear-down will\nbe blocked until the poll returns, it means that f_count is already\ndead, and any use of it won't actually get a reference to the file any\nmore: it's dead regardless.\n\nMake sure we have a valid ref on the file pointer before we call down to\nvfs_poll() from the epoll routines.",
