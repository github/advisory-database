  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nax25: Fix reference count leak issues of ax25_dev\n\nThe ax25_addr_ax25dev() and ax25_dev_device_down() exist a reference\ncount leak issue of the object \"ax25_dev\".\n\nMemory leak issue in ax25_addr_ax25dev():\n\nThe reference count of the object \"ax25_dev\" can be increased multiple\ntimes in ax25_addr_ax25dev(). This will cause a memory leak.\n\nMemory leak issues in ax25_dev_device_down():\n\nThe reference count of ax25_dev is set to 1 in ax25_dev_device_up() and\nthen increase the reference count when ax25_dev is added to ax25_dev_list.\nAs a result, the reference count of ax25_dev is 2. But when the device is\nshutting down. The ax25_dev_device_down() drops the reference count once\nor twice depending on if we goto unlock_put or not, which will cause\nmemory leak.\n\nAs for the issue of ax25_addr_ax25dev(), it is impossible for one pointer\nto be on a list twice. So add a break in ax25_addr_ax25dev(). As for the\nissue of ax25_dev_device_down(), increase the reference count of ax25_dev\nonce in ax25_dev_device_up() and decrease the reference count of ax25_dev\nafter it is removed from the ax25_dev_list.",
