  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nxen/console: harden hvc_xen against event channel storms\n\nThe Xen console driver is still vulnerable for an attack via excessive\nnumber of events sent by the backend. Fix that by using a lateeoi event\nchannel.\n\nFor the normal domU initial console this requires the introduction of\nbind_evtchn_to_irq_lateeoi() as there is no xenbus device available\nat the time the event channel is bound to the irq.\n\nAs the decision whether an interrupt was spurious or not requires to\ntest for bytes having been read from the backend, move sending the\nevent into the if statement, as sending an event without having found\nany bytes to be read is making no sense at all.\n\nThis is part of XSA-391\n\n---\nV2:\n- slightly adapt spurious irq detection (Jan Beulich)\nV3:\n- fix spurious irq detection (Jan Beulich)",
