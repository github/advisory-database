  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nASoC: codecs: wcd938x: fix incorrect used of portid\n\nMixer controls have the channel id in mixer->reg, which is not same\nas port id. port id should be derived from chan_info array.\nSo fix this. Without this, its possible that we could corrupt\nstruct wcd938x_sdw_priv by accessing port_map array out of range\nwith channel id instead of port id.",
