  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ni2c: acpi: Unbind mux adapters before delete\n\nThere is an issue with ACPI overlay table removal specifically related\nto I2C multiplexers.\n\nConsider an ACPI SSDT Overlay that defines a PCA9548 I2C mux on an\nexisting I2C bus. When this table is loaded we see the creation of a\ndevice for the overall PCA9548 chip and 8 further devices - one\ni2c_adapter each for the mux channels. These are all bound to their\nACPI equivalents via an eventual invocation of acpi_bind_one().\n\nWhen we unload the SSDT overlay we run into the problem. The ACPI\ndevices are deleted as normal via acpi_device_del_work_fn() and the\nacpi_device_del_list.\n\nHowever, the following warning and stack trace is output as the\ndeletion does not go smoothly:\n------------[ cut here ]------------\nkernfs: can not remove 'physical_node', no directory\nWARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 11 at fs/kernfs/dir.c:1674 kernfs_remove_by_name_ns+0xb9/0xc0\nModules linked in:\nCPU: 1 PID: 11 Comm: kworker/u128:0 Not tainted 6.8.0-rc6+ #1\nHardware name: congatec AG conga-B7E3/conga-B7E3, BIOS 5.13 05/16/2023\nWorkqueue: kacpi_hotplug acpi_device_del_work_fn\nRIP: 0010:kernfs_remove_by_name_ns+0xb9/0xc0\nCode: e4 00 48 89 ef e8 07 71 db ff 5b b8 fe ff ff ff 5d 41 5c 41 5d e9 a7 55 e4 00 0f 0b eb a6 48 c7 c7 f0 38 0d 9d e8 97 0a d5 ff <0f> 0b eb dc 0f 1f 00 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90\nRSP: 0018:ffff9f864008fb28 EFLAGS: 00010286\nRAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: ffff8ef90a8d4940 RCX: 0000000000000000\nRDX: ffff8f000e267d10 RSI: ffff8f000e25c780 RDI: ffff8f000e25c780\nRBP: ffff8ef9186f9870 R08: 0000000000013ffb R09: 00000000ffffbfff\nR10: 00000000ffffbfff R11: ffff8f000e0a0000 R12: ffff9f864008fb50\nR13: ffff8ef90c93dd60 R14: ffff8ef9010d0958 R15: ffff8ef9186f98c8\nFS:  0000000000000000(0000) GS:ffff8f000e240000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\nCS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\nCR2: 00007f48f5253a08 CR3: 00000003cb82e000 CR4: 00000000003506f0\nCall Trace:\n <TASK>\n ? kernfs_remove_by_name_ns+0xb9/0xc0\n ? __warn+0x7c/0x130\n ? kernfs_remove_by_name_ns+0xb9/0xc0\n ? report_bug+0x171/0x1a0\n ? handle_bug+0x3c/0x70\n ? exc_invalid_op+0x17/0x70\n ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x1a/0x20\n ? kernfs_remove_by_name_ns+0xb9/0xc0\n ? kernfs_remove_by_name_ns+0xb9/0xc0\n acpi_unbind_one+0x108/0x180\n device_del+0x18b/0x490\n ? srso_return_thunk+0x5/0x5f\n ? srso_return_thunk+0x5/0x5f\n device_unregister+0xd/0x30\n i2c_del_adapter.part.0+0x1bf/0x250\n i2c_mux_del_adapters+0xa1/0xe0\n i2c_device_remove+0x1e/0x80\n device_release_driver_internal+0x19a/0x200\n bus_remove_device+0xbf/0x100\n device_del+0x157/0x490\n ? __pfx_device_match_fwnode+0x10/0x10\n ? srso_return_thunk+0x5/0x5f\n device_unregister+0xd/0x30\n i2c_acpi_notify+0x10f/0x140\n notifier_call_chain+0x58/0xd0\n blocking_notifier_call_chain+0x3a/0x60\n acpi_device_del_work_fn+0x85/0x1d0\n process_one_work+0x134/0x2f0\n worker_thread+0x2f0/0x410\n ? __pfx_worker_thread+0x10/0x10\n kthread+0xe3/0x110\n ? __pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10\n ret_from_fork+0x2f/0x50\n ? __pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10\n ret_from_fork_asm+0x1b/0x30\n </TASK>\n---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]---\n...\nrepeated 7 more times, 1 for each channel of the mux\n...\n\nThe issue is that the binding of the ACPI devices to their peer I2C\nadapters is not correctly cleaned up. Digging deeper into the issue we\nsee that the deletion order is such that the ACPI devices matching the\nmux channel i2c adapters are deleted first during the SSDT overlay\nremoval. For each of the channels we see a call to i2c_acpi_notify()\nwith ACPI_RECONFIG_DEVICE_REMOVE but, because these devices are not\nactually i2c_clients, nothing is done for them.\n\nLater on, after each of the mux channels has been dealt with, we come\nto delete the i2c_client representing the PCA9548 device. This is the\ncall stack we see above, whereby the kernel cleans up the i2c_client\nincluding destruction of the mux and its channel adapters. At this\npoint we do attempt to unbind from the ACPI peers but those peers \n---truncated---",
