  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: i2c: et8ek8: Don't strip remove function when driver is builtin\n\nUsing __exit for the remove function results in the remove callback\nbeing discarded with CONFIG_VIDEO_ET8EK8=y. When such a device gets\nunbound (e.g. using sysfs or hotplug), the driver is just removed\nwithout the cleanup being performed. This results in resource leaks. Fix\nit by compiling in the remove callback unconditionally.\n\nThis also fixes a W=1 modpost warning:\n\n\tWARNING: modpost: drivers/media/i2c/et8ek8/et8ek8: section mismatch in reference: et8ek8_i2c_driver+0x10 (section: .data) -> et8ek8_remove (section: .exit.text)",
