  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnilfs2: fix use-after-free of timer for log writer thread\n\nPatch series \"nilfs2: fix log writer related issues\".\n\nThis bug fix series covers three nilfs2 log writer-related issues,\nincluding a timer use-after-free issue and potential deadlock issue on\nunmount, and a potential freeze issue in event synchronization found\nduring their analysis.  Details are described in each commit log.\n\n\nThis patch (of 3):\n\nA use-after-free issue has been reported regarding the timer sc_timer on\nthe nilfs_sc_info structure.\n\nThe problem is that even though it is used to wake up a sleeping log\nwriter thread, sc_timer is not shut down until the nilfs_sc_info structure\nis about to be freed, and is used regardless of the thread's lifetime.\n\nFix this issue by limiting the use of sc_timer only while the log writer\nthread is alive.",
