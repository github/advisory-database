  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\naudit: improve robustness of the audit queue handling\n\nIf the audit daemon were ever to get stuck in a stopped state the\nkernel's kauditd_thread() could get blocked attempting to send audit\nrecords to the userspace audit daemon.  With the kernel thread\nblocked it is possible that the audit queue could grow unbounded as\ncertain audit record generating events must be exempt from the queue\nlimits else the system enter a deadlock state.\n\nThis patch resolves this problem by lowering the kernel thread's\nsocket sending timeout from MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT to HZ/10 and tweaks\nthe kauditd_send_queue() function to better manage the various audit\nqueues when connection problems occur between the kernel and the\naudit daemon.  With this patch, the backlog may temporarily grow\nbeyond the defined limits when the audit daemon is stopped and the\nsystem is under heavy audit pressure, but kauditd_thread() will\ncontinue to make progress and drain the queues as it would for other\nconnection problems.  For example, with the audit daemon put into a\nstopped state and the system configured to audit every syscall it\nwas still possible to shutdown the system without a kernel panic,\ndeadlock, etc.; granted, the system was slow to shutdown but that is\nto be expected given the extreme pressure of recording every syscall.\n\nThe timeout value of HZ/10 was chosen primarily through\nexperimentation and this developer's \"gut feeling\".  There is likely\nno one perfect value, but as this scenario is limited in scope (root\nprivileges would be needed to send SIGSTOP to the audit daemon), it\nis likely not worth exposing this as a tunable at present.  This can\nalways be done at a later date if it proves necessary.",
