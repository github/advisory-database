  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nerofs: fix out-of-bound access when z_erofs_gbuf_growsize() partially fails\n\nIf z_erofs_gbuf_growsize() partially fails on a global buffer due to\nmemory allocation failure or fault injection (as reported by syzbot [1]),\nnew pages need to be freed by comparing to the existing pages to avoid\nmemory leaks.\n\nHowever, the old gbuf->pages[] array may not be large enough, which can\nlead to null-ptr-deref or out-of-bound access.\n\nFix this by checking against gbuf->nrpages in advance.\n\n[1] https://lore.kernel.org/r/000000000000f7b96e062018c6e3@google.com",
