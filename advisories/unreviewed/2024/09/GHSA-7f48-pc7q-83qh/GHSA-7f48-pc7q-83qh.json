  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvideo/aperture: optionally match the device in sysfb_disable()\n\nIn aperture_remove_conflicting_pci_devices(), we currently only\ncall sysfb_disable() on vga class devices.  This leads to the\nfollowing problem when the pimary device is not VGA compatible:\n\n1. A PCI device with a non-VGA class is the boot display\n2. That device is probed first and it is not a VGA device so\n   sysfb_disable() is not called, but the device resources\n   are freed by aperture_detach_platform_device()\n3. Non-primary GPU has a VGA class and it ends up calling sysfb_disable()\n4. NULL pointer dereference via sysfb_disable() since the resources\n   have already been freed by aperture_detach_platform_device() when\n   it was called by the other device.\n\nFix this by passing a device pointer to sysfb_disable() and checking\nthe device to determine if we should execute it or not.\n\nv2: Fix build when CONFIG_SCREEN_INFO is not set\nv3: Move device check into the mutex\n    Drop primary variable in aperture_remove_conflicting_pci_devices()\n    Drop __init on pci sysfb_pci_dev_is_enabled()",
