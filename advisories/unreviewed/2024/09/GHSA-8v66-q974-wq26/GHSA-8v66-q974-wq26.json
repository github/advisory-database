  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ns390/boot: Avoid possible physmem_info segment corruption\n\nWhen physical memory for the kernel image is allocated it does not\nconsider extra memory required for offsetting the image start to\nmatch it with the lower 20 bits of KASLR virtual base address. That\nmight lead to kernel access beyond its memory range.",
