  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsoc: qcom: cmd-db: Map shared memory as WC, not WB\n\nLinux does not write into cmd-db region. This region of memory is write\nprotected by XPU. XPU may sometime falsely detect clean cache eviction\nas \"write\" into the write protected region leading to secure interrupt\nwhich causes an endless loop somewhere in Trust Zone.\n\nThe only reason it is working right now is because Qualcomm Hypervisor\nmaps the same region as Non-Cacheable memory in Stage 2 translation\ntables. The issue manifests if we want to use another hypervisor (like\nXen or KVM), which does not know anything about those specific mappings.\n\nChanging the mapping of cmd-db memory from MEMREMAP_WB to MEMREMAP_WT/WC\nremoves dependency on correct mappings in Stage 2 tables. This patch\nfixes the issue by updating the mapping to MEMREMAP_WC.\n\nI tested this on SA8155P with Xen.",
