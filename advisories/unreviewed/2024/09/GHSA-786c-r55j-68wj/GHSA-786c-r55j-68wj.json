  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nlibfs: fix get_stashed_dentry()\n\nget_stashed_dentry() tries to optimistically retrieve a stashed dentry\nfrom a provided location.  It needs to ensure to hold rcu lock before it\ndereference the stashed location to prevent UAF issues.  Use\nrcu_dereference() instead of READ_ONCE() it's effectively equivalent\nwith some lockdep bells and whistles and it communicates clearly that\nthis expects rcu protection.",
