  "details": "The session hijacking attack targets the application layer's control mechanism, which manages authenticated sessions between a host PC and a PLC. During such sessions, a session key is utilized to maintain security. However, if an attacker captures this session key, they can inject traffic into an ongoing authenticated session. To successfully achieve this, the attacker also needs to spoof both the IP address and MAC address of the originating host which is typical of a session-based attack.",
