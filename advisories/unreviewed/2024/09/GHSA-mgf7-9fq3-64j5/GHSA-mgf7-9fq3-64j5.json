  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmptcp: pm: avoid possible UaF when selecting endp\n\nselect_local_address() and select_signal_address() both select an\nendpoint entry from the list inside an RCU protected section, but return\na reference to it, to be read later on. If the entry is dereferenced\nafter the RCU unlock, reading info could cause a Use-after-Free.\n\nA simple solution is to copy the required info while inside the RCU\nprotected section to avoid any risk of UaF later. The address ID might\nneed to be modified later to handle the ID0 case later, so a copy seems\nOK to deal with.",
