  "details": "A flaw was found in Envoy. It is possible to modify or manipulate headers from external clients when pass-through routes are used for the ingress gateway. This issue could allow a malicious user to forge what is logged by Envoy as a requested path and cause the Envoy proxy to make requests to internal-only services or arbitrary external systems. This is a regression of the fix for CVE-2023-27487.",
