  "details": "A vulnerability in the process that classifies traffic that is going to the Unified Threat Defense (UTD) component of Cisco IOS XE Software in controller mode could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.\n\n This vulnerability exists because UTD improperly handles certain packets as those packets egress an SD-WAN IPsec tunnel. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted traffic through an SD-WAN IPsec tunnel that is configured on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.\n\n Note: SD-WAN tunnels that are configured with Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) are not affected by this vulnerability.",
