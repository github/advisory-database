  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amd/display: Don't refer to dc_sink in is_dsc_need_re_compute\n\n[Why]\nWhen unplug one of monitors connected after mst hub, encounter null pointer dereference.\n\nIt's due to dc_sink get released immediately in early_unregister() or detect_ctx(). When\ncommit new state which directly referring to info stored in dc_sink will cause null pointer\ndereference.\n\n[how]\nRemove redundant checking condition. Relevant condition should already be covered by checking\nif dsc_aux is null or not. Also reset dsc_aux to NULL when the connector is disconnected.",
