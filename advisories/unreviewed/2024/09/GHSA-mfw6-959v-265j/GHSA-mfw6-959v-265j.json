  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmptcp: pm: only mark 'subflow' endp as available\n\nAdding the following warning ...\n\n  WARN_ON_ONCE(msk->pm.local_addr_used == 0)\n\n... before decrementing the local_addr_used counter helped to find a bug\nwhen running the \"remove single address\" subtest from the mptcp_join.sh\nselftests.\n\nRemoving a 'signal' endpoint will trigger the removal of all subflows\nlinked to this endpoint via mptcp_pm_nl_rm_addr_or_subflow() with\nrm_type == MPTCP_MIB_RMSUBFLOW. This will decrement the local_addr_used\ncounter, which is wrong in this case because this counter is linked to\n'subflow' endpoints, and here it is a 'signal' endpoint that is being\nremoved.\n\nNow, the counter is decremented, only if the ID is being used outside\nof mptcp_pm_nl_rm_addr_or_subflow(), only for 'subflow' endpoints, and\nif the ID is not 0 -- local_addr_used is not taking into account these\nones. This marking of the ID as being available, and the decrement is\ndone no matter if a subflow using this ID is currently available,\nbecause the subflow could have been closed before.",
