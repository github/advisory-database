  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: rtw88: usb: schedule rx work after everything is set up\n\nRight now it's possible to hit NULL pointer dereference in\nrtw_rx_fill_rx_status on hw object and/or its fields because\ninitialization routine can start getting USB replies before\nrtw_dev is fully setup.\n\nThe stack trace looks like this:\n\nrtw_rx_fill_rx_status\nrtw8821c_query_rx_desc\nrtw_usb_rx_handler\n...\nqueue_work\nrtw_usb_read_port_complete\n...\nusb_submit_urb\nrtw_usb_rx_resubmit\nrtw_usb_init_rx\nrtw_usb_probe\n\nSo while we do the async stuff rtw_usb_probe continues and calls\nrtw_register_hw, which does all kinds of initialization (e.g.\nvia ieee80211_register_hw) that rtw_rx_fill_rx_status relies on.\n\nFix this by moving the first usb_submit_urb after everything\nis set up.\n\nFor me, this bug manifested as:\n[    8.893177] rtw_8821cu 1-1:1.2: band wrong, packet dropped\n[    8.910904] rtw_8821cu 1-1:1.2: hw->conf.chandef.chan NULL in rtw_rx_fill_rx_status\nbecause I'm using Larry's backport of rtw88 driver with the NULL\nchecks in rtw_rx_fill_rx_status.",
