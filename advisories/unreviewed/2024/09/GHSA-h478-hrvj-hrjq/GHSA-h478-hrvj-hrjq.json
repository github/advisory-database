  "details": "A vulnerability classified as critical has been found in playSMS 1.4.4/1.4.5/1.4.6/1.4.7. Affected is an unknown function of the file /playsms/index.php?app=main&inc=core_auth&route=forgot&op=forgot of the component Template Handler. The manipulation of the argument username/email/captcha leads to code injection. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitability is told to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component. The project maintainer was informed early about the issue. Investigation shows that playSMS up to 1.4.3 contained a fix but later versions re-introduced the flaw. As long as the latest version of the playsms/tpl package is used, the software is not affected. Version >=1.4.4 shall fix this issue for sure.",
