  "details": "Sony XAV-AX5500 CarPlay TLV Stack-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows physically present attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of \tSony XAV-AX5500 devices. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the implementation of the Apple CarPlay protocol. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the device.\n\nWas ZDI-CAN-23238",
