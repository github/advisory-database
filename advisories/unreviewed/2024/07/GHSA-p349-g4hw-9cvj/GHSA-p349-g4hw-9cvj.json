  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncachestat: do not flush stats in recency check\n\nsyzbot detects that cachestat() is flushing stats, which can sleep, in its\nRCU read section (see [1]).  This is done in the workingset_test_recent()\nstep (which checks if the folio's eviction is recent).\n\nMove the stat flushing step to before the RCU read section of cachestat,\nand skip stat flushing during the recency check.\n\n[1]: https://lore.kernel.org/cgroups/000000000000f71227061bdf97e0@google.com/",
