  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmips: bmips: BCM6358: make sure CBR is correctly set\n\nIt was discovered that some device have CBR address set to 0 causing\nkernel panic when arch_sync_dma_for_cpu_all is called.\n\nThis was notice in situation where the system is booted from TP1 and\nBMIPS_GET_CBR() returns 0 instead of a valid address and\n!!(read_c0_brcm_cmt_local() & (1 << 31)); not failing.\n\nThe current check whether RAC flush should be disabled or not are not\nenough hence lets check if CBR is a valid address or not.",
