  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsched/deadline: Fix task_struct reference leak\n\nDuring the execution of the following stress test with linux-rt:\n\nstress-ng --cyclic 30 --timeout 30 --minimize --quiet\n\nkmemleak frequently reported a memory leak concerning the task_struct:\n\nunreferenced object 0xffff8881305b8000 (size 16136):\n  comm \"stress-ng\", pid 614, jiffies 4294883961 (age 286.412s)\n  object hex dump (first 32 bytes):\n    02 40 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  .@..............\n    00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................\n  debug hex dump (first 16 bytes):\n    53 09 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  S...............\n  backtrace:\n    [<00000000046b6790>] dup_task_struct+0x30/0x540\n    [<00000000c5ca0f0b>] copy_process+0x3d9/0x50e0\n    [<00000000ced59777>] kernel_clone+0xb0/0x770\n    [<00000000a50befdc>] __do_sys_clone+0xb6/0xf0\n    [<000000001dbf2008>] do_syscall_64+0x5d/0xf0\n    [<00000000552900ff>] entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x6e/0x76\n\nThe issue occurs in start_dl_timer(), which increments the task_struct\nreference count and sets a timer. The timer callback, dl_task_timer,\nis supposed to decrement the reference count upon expiration. However,\nif enqueue_task_dl() is called before the timer expires and cancels it,\nthe reference count is not decremented, leading to the leak.\n\nThis patch fixes the reference leak by ensuring the task_struct\nreference count is properly decremented when the timer is canceled.",
