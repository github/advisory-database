That commit introduced\nvma->fence->active in order for the fence_update() to be able to wait\nselectively on that one instead of vma->active since only idleness of\nfence registers was needed.  But then, another commit 0d86ee35097a\n(\"drm/i915/gt: Make fence revocation unequivocal\") replaced the call to\nfence_update() in i915_vma_revoke_fence() with only fence_write(), and\nalso added that GEM_BUG_ON(!i915_active_is_idle(&fence->active)) in front.\nNo justification was provided on why we might then expect idleness of\nvma->fence->active without first waiting on it.\n\nThe issue can be potentially caused by a race among revocation of fence\nregisters on one side and sequential execution of signal callbacks invoked\non completion of a request that was using them on the other, still\nprocessed in parallel to revocation of those fence registers.  Fix it by\nwaiting for idleness of vma->fence->active in i915_vma_revoke_fence().\n\n(cherry picked from commit 24bb052d3dd499c5956abad5f7d8e4fd07da7fb1)",
