  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: fix a memleak when uncloning an skb dst and its metadata\n\nWhen uncloning an skb dst and its associated metadata, a new\ndst+metadata is allocated and later replaces the old one in the skb.\nThis is helpful to have a non-shared dst+metadata attached to a specific\nskb.\n\nThe issue is the uncloned dst+metadata is initialized with a refcount of\n1, which is increased to 2 before attaching it to the skb. When\ntun_dst_unclone returns, the dst+metadata is only referenced from a\nsingle place (the skb) while its refcount is 2. Its refcount will never\ndrop to 0 (when the skb is consumed), leading to a memory leak.\n\nFix this by removing the call to dst_hold in tun_dst_unclone, as the\ndst+metadata refcount is already 1.",
