  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntcp: avoid too many retransmit packets\n\nIf a TCP socket is using TCP_USER_TIMEOUT, and the other peer\nretracted its window to zero, tcp_retransmit_timer() can\nretransmit a packet every two jiffies (2 ms for HZ=1000),\nfor about 4 minutes after TCP_USER_TIMEOUT has 'expired'.\n\nThe fix is to make sure tcp_rtx_probe0_timed_out() takes\nicsk->icsk_user_timeout into account.\n\nBefore blamed commit, the socket would not timeout after\nicsk->icsk_user_timeout, but would use standard exponential\nbackoff for the retransmits.\n\nAlso worth noting that before commit e89688e3e978 (\"net: tcp:\nfix unexcepted socket die when snd_wnd is 0\"), the issue\nwould last 2 minutes instead of 4.",
