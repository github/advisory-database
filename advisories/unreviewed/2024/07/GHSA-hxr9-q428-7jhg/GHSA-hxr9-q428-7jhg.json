  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nio_uring: fix possible deadlock in io_register_iowq_max_workers()\n\nThe io_register_iowq_max_workers() function calls io_put_sq_data(),\nwhich acquires the sqd->lock without releasing the uring_lock.\nSimilar to the commit 009ad9f0c6ee (\"io_uring: drop ctx->uring_lock\nbefore acquiring sqd->lock\"), this can lead to a potential deadlock\nsituation.\n\nTo resolve this issue, the uring_lock is released before calling\nio_put_sq_data(), and then it is re-acquired after the function call.\n\nThis change ensures that the locks are acquired in the correct\norder, preventing the possibility of a deadlock.",
