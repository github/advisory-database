  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncxl/mem: Fix no cxl_nvd during pmem region auto-assembling\n\nWhen CXL subsystem is auto-assembling a pmem region during cxl\nendpoint port probing, always hit below calltrace.\n\n BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000078\n #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode\n #PF: error_code(0x0000) - not-present page\n RIP: 0010:cxl_pmem_region_probe+0x22e/0x360 [cxl_pmem]\n Call Trace:\n  <TASK>\n  ? __die+0x24/0x70\n  ? page_fault_oops+0x82/0x160\n  ? do_user_addr_fault+0x65/0x6b0\n  ? exc_page_fault+0x7d/0x170\n  ? asm_exc_page_fault+0x26/0x30\n  ? cxl_pmem_region_probe+0x22e/0x360 [cxl_pmem]\n  ? cxl_pmem_region_probe+0x1ac/0x360 [cxl_pmem]\n  cxl_bus_probe+0x1b/0x60 [cxl_core]\n  really_probe+0x173/0x410\n  ? __pfx___device_attach_driver+0x10/0x10\n  __driver_probe_device+0x80/0x170\n  driver_probe_device+0x1e/0x90\n  __device_attach_driver+0x90/0x120\n  bus_for_each_drv+0x84/0xe0\n  __device_attach+0xbc/0x1f0\n  bus_probe_device+0x90/0xa0\n  device_add+0x51c/0x710\n  devm_cxl_add_pmem_region+0x1b5/0x380 [cxl_core]\n  cxl_bus_probe+0x1b/0x60 [cxl_core]\n\nThe cxl_nvd of the memdev needs to be available during the pmem region\nprobe. Currently the cxl_nvd is registered after the endpoint port probe.\nThe endpoint probe, in the case of autoassembly of regions, can cause a\npmem region probe requiring the not yet available cxl_nvd. Adjust the\nsequence so this dependency is met.\n\nThis requires adding a port parameter to cxl_find_nvdimm_bridge() that\ncan be used to query the ancestor root port. The endpoint port is not\nyet available, but will share a common ancestor with its parent, so\nstart the query from there instead.",
