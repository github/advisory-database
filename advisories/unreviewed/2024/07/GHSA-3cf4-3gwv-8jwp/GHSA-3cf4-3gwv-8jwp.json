  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nRevert \"mm/writeback: fix possible divide-by-zero in wb_dirty_limits(), again\"\n\nPatch series \"mm: Avoid possible overflows in dirty throttling\".\n\nDirty throttling logic assumes dirty limits in page units fit into\n32-bits.  This patch series makes sure this is true (see patch 2/2 for\nmore details).\n\n\nThis patch (of 2):\n\nThis reverts commit 9319b647902cbd5cc884ac08a8a6d54ce111fc78.\n\nThe commit is broken in several ways.  Firstly, the removed (u64) cast\nfrom the multiplication will introduce a multiplication overflow on 32-bit\narchs if wb_thresh * bg_thresh >= 1<<32 (which is actually common - the\ndefault settings with 4GB of RAM will trigger this).  Secondly, the\ndiv64_u64() is unnecessarily expensive on 32-bit archs.  We have\ndiv64_ul() in case we want to be safe & cheap.  Thirdly, if dirty\nthresholds are larger than 1<<32 pages, then dirty balancing is going to\nblow up in many other spectacular ways anyway so trying to fix one\npossible overflow is just moot.",
