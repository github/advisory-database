  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npinctrl: fix deadlock in create_pinctrl() when handling -EPROBE_DEFER\n\nIn create_pinctrl(), pinctrl_maps_mutex is acquired before calling\nadd_setting(). If add_setting() returns -EPROBE_DEFER, create_pinctrl()\ncalls pinctrl_free(). However, pinctrl_free() attempts to acquire\npinctrl_maps_mutex, which is already held by create_pinctrl(), leading to\na potential deadlock.\n\nThis patch resolves the issue by releasing pinctrl_maps_mutex before\ncalling pinctrl_free(), preventing the deadlock.\n\nThis bug was discovered and resolved using Coverity Static Analysis\nSecurity Testing (SAST) by Synopsys, Inc.",
