  "details": "The Download Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'wpdm_all_packages' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.97 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on the 'cols' parameter. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
