  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetfilter: nf_tables: prefer nft_chain_validate\n\nnft_chain_validate already performs loop detection because a cycle will\nresult in a call stack overflow (ctx->level >= NFT_JUMP_STACK_SIZE).\n\nIt also follows maps via ->validate callback in nft_lookup, so there\nappears no reason to iterate the maps again.\n\nnf_tables_check_loops() and all its helper functions can be removed.\nThis improves ruleset load time significantly, from 23s down to 12s.\n\nThis also fixes a crash bug. Old loop detection code can result in\nunbounded recursion:\n\nBUG: TASK stack guard page was hit at ....\nOops: stack guard page: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP KASAN\nCPU: 4 PID: 1539 Comm: nft Not tainted 6.10.0-rc5+ #1\n[..]\n\nwith a suitable ruleset during validation of register stores.\n\nI can't see any actual reason to attempt to check for this from\nnft_validate_register_store(), at this point the transaction is still in\nprogress, so we don't have a full picture of the rule graph.\n\nFor nf-next it might make sense to either remove it or make this depend\non table->validate_state in case we could catch an error earlier\n(for improved error reporting to userspace).",
