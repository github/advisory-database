  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/xe: Check pat.ops before dumping PAT settings\n\nWe may leave pat.ops unset when running on brand new platform or\nwhen running as a VF.  While the former is unlikely, the latter\nis valid (future) use case and will cause NPD when someone will\ntry to dump PAT settings by debugfs.\n\nIt's better to check pointer to pat.ops instead of specific .dump\nhook, as we have this hook always defined for every .ops variant.",
