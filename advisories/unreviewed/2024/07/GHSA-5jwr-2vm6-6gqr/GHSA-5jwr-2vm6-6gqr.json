  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/page_table_check: fix crash on ZONE_DEVICE\n\nNot all pages may apply to pgtable check.  One example is ZONE_DEVICE\npages: they map PFNs directly, and they don't allocate page_ext at all\neven if there's struct page around.  One may reference\ndevm_memremap_pages().\n\nWhen both ZONE_DEVICE and page-table-check enabled, then try to map some\ndax memories, one can trigger kernel bug constantly now when the kernel\nwas trying to inject some pfn maps on the dax device:\n\n kernel BUG at mm/page_table_check.c:55!\n\nWhile it's pretty legal to use set_pxx_at() for ZONE_DEVICE pages for page\nfault resolutions, skip all the checks if page_ext doesn't even exist in\npgtable checker, which applies to ZONE_DEVICE but maybe more.",
