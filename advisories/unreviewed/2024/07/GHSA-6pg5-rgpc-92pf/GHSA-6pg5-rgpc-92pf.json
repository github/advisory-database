  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nAvoid hw_desc array overrun in dw-axi-dmac\n\nI have a use case where nr_buffers = 3 and in which each descriptor is composed by 3\nsegments, resulting in the DMA channel descs_allocated to be 9. Since axi_desc_put()\nhandles the hw_desc considering the descs_allocated, this scenario would result in a\nkernel panic (hw_desc array will be overrun).\n\nTo fix this, the proposal is to add a new member to the axi_dma_desc structure,\nwhere we keep the number of allocated hw_descs (axi_desc_alloc()) and use it in\naxi_desc_put() to handle the hw_desc array correctly.\n\nAdditionally I propose to remove the axi_chan_start_first_queued() call after completing\nthe transfer, since it was identified that unbalance can occur (started descriptors can\nbe interrupted and transfer ignored due to DMA channel not being enabled).",
