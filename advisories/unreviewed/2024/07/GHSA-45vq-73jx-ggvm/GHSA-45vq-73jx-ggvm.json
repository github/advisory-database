  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nIB/core: Implement a limit on UMAD receive List\n\nThe existing behavior of ib_umad, which maintains received MAD\npackets in an unbounded list, poses a risk of uncontrolled growth.\nAs user-space applications extract packets from this list, the rate\nof extraction may not match the rate of incoming packets, leading\nto potential list overflow.\n\nTo address this, we introduce a limit to the size of the list. After\nconsidering typical scenarios, such as OpenSM processing, which can\nhandle approximately 100k packets per second, and the 1-second retry\ntimeout for most packets, we set the list size limit to 200k. Packets\nreceived beyond this limit are dropped, assuming they are likely timed\nout by the time they are handled by user-space.\n\nNotably, packets queued on the receive list due to reasons like\ntimed-out sends are preserved even when the list is full.",
