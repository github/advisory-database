  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/drm_file: Fix pid refcounting race\n\n\nfilp->pid is supposed to be a refcounted pointer; however, before this\npatch, drm_file_update_pid() only increments the refcount of a struct\npid after storing a pointer to it in filp->pid and dropping the\ndev->filelist_mutex, making the following race possible:\n\nprocess A               process B\n=========               =========\n                        begin drm_file_update_pid\n                        mutex_lock(&dev->filelist_mutex)\n                        rcu_replace_pointer(filp->pid, <pid B>, 1)\n                        mutex_unlock(&dev->filelist_mutex)\nbegin drm_file_update_pid\nmutex_lock(&dev->filelist_mutex)\nrcu_replace_pointer(filp->pid, <pid A>, 1)\nmutex_unlock(&dev->filelist_mutex)\nget_pid(<pid A>)\nsynchronize_rcu()\nput_pid(<pid B>)   *** pid B reaches refcount 0 and is freed here ***\n                        get_pid(<pid B>)   *** UAF ***\n                        synchronize_rcu()\n                        put_pid(<pid A>)\n\nAs far as I know, this race can only occur with CONFIG_PREEMPT_RCU=y\nbecause it requires RCU to detect a quiescent state in code that is not\nexplicitly calling into the scheduler.\n\nThis race leads to use-after-free of a \"struct pid\".\nIt is probably somewhat hard to hit because process A has to pass\nthrough a synchronize_rcu() operation while process B is between\nmutex_unlock() and get_pid().\n\nFix it by ensuring that by the time a pointer to the current task's pid\nis stored in the file, an extra reference to the pid has been taken.\n\nThis fix also removes the condition for synchronize_rcu(); I think\nthat optimization is unnecessary complexity, since in that case we\nwould usually have bailed out on the lockless check above.",
