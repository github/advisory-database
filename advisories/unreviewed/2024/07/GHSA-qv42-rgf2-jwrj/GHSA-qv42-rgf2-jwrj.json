  "details": "Premiere Pro versions 23.6.5, 24.4.1 and earlier are affected by an Untrusted Search Path vulnerability that could lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inserting a malicious file into the search path, which the application might execute instead of the legitimate file. This could occur when the application uses a search path to locate executables or libraries. Exploitation of this issue requires user interaction, attack complexity is high.",
