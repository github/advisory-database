  ],
  "details": "The WordPress Button Plugin MaxButtons plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in all versions up to, and including, 9.7.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled. Administrators can give button creation privileges to users with lower levels (contributor+) which would allow those lower-privileged users to carry out attacks.",
