  "details": "The current setup of the quarantine page tables assumes that the\nquarantine domain (dom_io) has been initialized with an address width\nof DEFAULT_DOMAIN_ADDRESS_WIDTH (48) and hence 4 page table levels.\n\nHowever dom_io being a PV domain gets the AMD-Vi IOMMU page tables\nlevels based on the maximum (hot pluggable) RAM address, and hence on\nsystems with no RAM above the 512GB mark only 3 page-table levels are\nconfigured in the IOMMU.\n\nOn systems without RAM above the 512GB boundary\namd_iommu_quarantine_init() will setup page tables for the scratch\npage with 4 levels, while the IOMMU will be configured to use 3 levels\nonly, resulting in the last page table directory (PDE) effectively\nbecoming a page table entry (PTE), and hence a device in quarantine\nmode gaining write access to the page destined to be a PDE.\n\nDue to this page table level mismatch, the sink page the device gets\nread/write access to is no longer cleared between device assignment,\npossibly leading to data leaks.\n",
