  "details": "\nAn Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input vulnerability in Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause Denial of Service (DoS).\n\nOn all Junos OS MX Series and SRX Series platforms, when SIP ALG is enabled, and a specific SIP packet is received and processed, NAT IP allocation fails for genuine traffic, which causes Denial of Service (DoS). Continuous receipt of this specific SIP ALG packet will cause a sustained DoS condition.\n\nNAT IP usage can be monitored by running the following command.\n\nuser@srx> show security nat resource-usage source-pool <source_pool_name>\n\n\nPool name: source_pool_name\n..\nAddress Factor-index Port-range Used Avail Total Usage\nX.X.X.X\n0 Single Ports 50258 52342 62464 96% <<<<<\n- Alg Ports 0 2048 2048 0%\nThis issue affects:\n\nJuniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series and SRX Series\n\n\n\n  *  All versions earlier than 21.2R3-S6;\n  *  21.3 versions earlier than 21.3R3-S5;\n  *  21.4 versions earlier than 21.4R3-S5;\n  *  22.1 versions earlier than 22.1R3-S4;\n  *  22.2 versions earlier than 22.2R3-S3;\n  *  22.3 versions earlier than 22.3R3-S1;\n  *  22.4 versions earlier than 22.4R2-S2, 22.4R3;\n  *  23.2 versions earlier than 23.2R1-S1, 23.2R2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
