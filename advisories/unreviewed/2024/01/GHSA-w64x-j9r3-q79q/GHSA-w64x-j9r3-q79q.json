Customers using an affected version must take immediate action.\n\nMost recent supported versions of Confluence Data Center and Server are not affected by this vulnerability as it was ultimately mitigated during regular version updates. However, Atlassian recommends that customers take care to install the latest version to protect their instances from non-critical vulnerabilities outlined in Atlassian’s January Security Bulletin.\n\nSee “What You Need to Do” for detailed instructions.\n \n{panel:bgColor=#deebff}\nAtlassian Cloud sites are not affected by this vulnerability.
