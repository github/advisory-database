  "details": "\nAn Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows a network-based, unauthenticated attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\nIf an attacker sends high rate of specific ICMP traffic to a device with VXLAN configured, this causes a deadlock of the PFE and results in the device becoming unresponsive. A manual restart will be required to recover the device.\n\nThis issue only affects EX4100, EX4400, EX4600, QFX5000 Series devices.\n\nThis issue affects:\n\nJuniper Networks Junos OS\n\n\n\n  *  21.4R3 versions earlier than 21.4R3-S4;\n  *  22.1R3 versions earlier than 22.1R3-S3;\n  *  22.2R2 versions earlier than 22.2R3-S1;\n  *  22.3 versions earlier than 22.3R2-S2, 22.3R3;\n  *  22.4 versions earlier than 22.4R2;\n  *  23.1 versions earlier than 23.1R2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
