  "details": "In Singular before 4.3.1, a predictable /tmp pathname is used (e.g., by sdb.cc), which allows local users to gain the privileges of other users via a procedure in a file under /tmp. NOTE: this CVE Record is about sdb.cc and similar files in the Singular interface that have predictable /tmp pathnames; this CVE Record is not about the lack of a safe temporary-file creation capability in the Singular language.",
