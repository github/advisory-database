  "details": "A vulnerability in the data plane microcode of Lightspeed-Plus line cards for Cisco ASR 9000 Series Aggregation Services Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the line card to reset. This vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of malformed packets that are received on the Lightspeed-Plus line cards. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IPv4 or IPv6 packet through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Lightspeed-Plus line card to reset, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition for any traffic that traverses that line card.",
