  "details": "Due to an Improper Initialization vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS on EX4650 devices, packets received on the management interface (em0) but not destined to the device, may be improperly forwarded to an egress interface, instead of being discarded. Such traffic being sent by a client may appear genuine, but is non-standard in nature and should be considered as potentially malicious. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS on EX4650 Series: All versions prior to 19.1R3-S8; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R3-S5; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R3-S5; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R3-S7; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R3-S3; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S4; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3-S3; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3-S2; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3-S1; 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3; 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R2; 21.4 versions prior to 21.4R2; 22.1 versions prior to 22.1R1.",
