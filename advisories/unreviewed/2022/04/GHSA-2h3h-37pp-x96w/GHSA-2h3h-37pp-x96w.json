  "details": "Buffer overflow in the open_socket_out function in socket.c for rsync 2.5.7 and earlier allows local users to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a long RSYNC_PROXY environment variable.  NOTE: since rsync is not setuid, this issue does not provide any additional privileges beyond those that are already available to the user.  Therefore this issue may be REJECTED in the future.",
