  "details": "The lack of validation of a key-value field in the Splunk-to-Splunk protocol results in a denial-of-service in Splunk Enterprise instances configured to index Universal Forwarder traffic. See https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Forwarding/Enableareceiver for more information on configuring an indexer to listen for UF traffic. It does not impact Universal Forwarders. When Splunk forwarding is secured using TLS or a Token, the attack requires compromising the certificate or token, or both. As a partial mitigation and a security best practice, see https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Security/ConfigureSplunkforwardingtousesignedcertificates and https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Forwarder/latest/Forwarder/Controlforwarderaccess. Implementation of either or both reduces the severity to Medium.",
