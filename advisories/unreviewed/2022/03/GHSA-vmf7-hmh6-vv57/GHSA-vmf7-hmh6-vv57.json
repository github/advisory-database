  "details": "A design flaw in all versions of Go-Ethereum allows an attacker node to send 5120 pending transactions of a high gas price from one account that all fully spend the full balance of the account to a victim Geth node, which can purge all of pending transactions in a victim node's memory pool and then occupy the memory pool to prevent new transactions from entering the pool, resulting in a denial of service (DoS).",
