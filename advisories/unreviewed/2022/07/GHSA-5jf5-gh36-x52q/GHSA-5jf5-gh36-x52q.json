  "details": "An Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an adjacent unauthenticated attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). The issue is caused by malformed MLD packets looping on a multi-homed Ethernet Segment Identifier (ESI) when VXLAN is configured. These MLD packets received on a multi-homed ESI are sent to the peer, and then incorrectly forwarded out the same ESI, violating the split horizon rule. This issue only affects QFX10K Series switches, including the QFX10002, QFX10008, and QFX10016. Other products and platforms are unaffected by this vulnerability. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on QFX10K Series: All versions prior to 19.1R3-S9; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S9, 19.2R3-S5; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R3-S6; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R2-S7, 19.4R3-S8; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R3-S4; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S4; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3-S2; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3-S2; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3; 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R2-S1, 21.2R3; 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R2.",
