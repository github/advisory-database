  "details": "Multiple Improper Access Control was discovered in Nokia AirFrame BMC Web GUI < R18 Firmware v4.13.00. It does not properly validate requests for access to (or editing of) data and functionality in all endpoints under /#settings/* and /api/settings/*. By not verifying the permissions for access to resources, it allows a potential attacker to view pages, with sensitive data, that are not allowed, and modify system configurations also causing DoS, which should be accessed only by user with administration profile, bypassing all controls (without checking for user identity).",
