  "details": "** DISPUTED ** The Visual Voice Mail (VVM) application through 2022-02-24 for Android allows persistent access if an attacker temporarily controls an application that has the READ_SMS permission, and reads an IMAP credentialing message that is (by design) not displayed to the victim within the AOSP SMS/MMS messaging application. (Often, the IMAP credentials are usable to listen to voice mail messages sent before the vulnerability was exploited, in addition to new ones.) NOTE: some vendors characterize this as not a \"concrete and exploitable risk.\"",
