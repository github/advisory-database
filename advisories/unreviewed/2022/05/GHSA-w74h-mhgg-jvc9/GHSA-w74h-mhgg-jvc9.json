  "details": "In the OMXNodeInstance::useBuffer and IOMX::freeBuffer functions, there is a possible use after free due to a race condition if the user frees the buffer while it's being used in another thread. This could lead to a local elevation of privilege enabling code execution as a privileged process with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is needed for exploitation.
