  ],
  "details": "A vulnerability in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) input packet processor of Cisco FXOS Software and Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the SNMP application to leak system memory, which could cause an affected device to restart unexpectedly. The vulnerability is due to improper error handling when processing inbound SNMP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending multiple crafted SNMP packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the SNMP application to leak system memory because of an improperly handled error condition during packet processing. Over time, this memory leak could cause the SNMP application to restart multiple times, leading to a system-level restart and a denial of service (DoS) condition.",
