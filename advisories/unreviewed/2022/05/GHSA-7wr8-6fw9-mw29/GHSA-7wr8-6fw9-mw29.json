  "details": "deepin-clone before 1.1.3 uses a predictable path /tmp/.deepin-clone/mount/<block-dev-basename> in the Helper::temporaryMountDevice() function to temporarily mount a file system as root. An unprivileged user can prepare a symlink at this location to have the file system mounted in an arbitrary location. By winning a race condition, the attacker can also enter the mount point, thereby preventing a subsequent unmount of the file system.",
