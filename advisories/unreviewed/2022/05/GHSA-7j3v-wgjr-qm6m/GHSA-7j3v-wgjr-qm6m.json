  ],
  "details": "An issue was discovered on Vera VeraEdge 1.7.19 and Veralite 1.7.481 devices. The device provides a script file called \"get_file.sh\" which allows a user to retrieve any file stored in the \"cmh-ext\" folder on the device. However, the \"filename\" parameter is not validated correctly and this allows an attacker to directory traverse outside the /cmh-ext folder and read any file on the device. It is necessary to create the folder \"cmh-ext\" on the device which can be executed by an attacker first in an unauthenticated fashion and then execute a directory traversal attack.",
