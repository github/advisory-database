  "details": "The Quest Kace K1000 Appliance, versions prior to 9.0.270, allows an authenticated least privileged user with 'User Console Only' rights to potentially inject arbitrary JavaScript code on the tickets page. Script execution could allow a malicious user of the system to steal session cookies of other users including Administrator and take over their session. This can further be exploited to launch other attacks. The software also does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.
