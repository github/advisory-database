  "details": "** DISPUTED ** The K2 component 2.8.0 for Joomla! has Incorrect Access Control with directory traversal, allowing an attacker to download arbitrary files, as demonstrated by a view=media&task=connector&cmd=file&target=l1_../configuration.php&download=1 request. The specific pathname ../configuration.php should be base64 encoded for a valid attack. NOTE: the vendor disputes this issue because only files under the media-manager path can be downloaded, and the documentation indicates that sensitive information does not belong there. Nonetheless, 2.8.1 has additional blocking of .php downloads.",
