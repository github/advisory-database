  ],
  "details": "A vulnerability in the Python scripting subsystem of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to escape the Python parser and gain unauthorized access to the underlying operating system of the device. The vulnerability exists due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied parameters that are passed to certain Python functions within the scripting sandbox of the affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to escape the scripting sandbox and execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with the privileges of the authenticated user. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have local access and be authenticated to the targeted device with administrative or Python execution privileges. These requirements could limit the possibility of a successful exploit. This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running Cisco NX-OS Software: Multilayer Director Switches, Nexus 2000 Series Fabric Extenders, Nexus 3000 Series Switches, Nexus 3500 Platform Switches, Nexus 5000 Series Switches, Nexus 5500 Platform Switches, Nexus 5600 Platform Switches, Nexus 6000 Series Switches, Nexus 7000 Series Switches, Nexus 7700 Series Switches, Nexus 9000 Series Switches - Standalone, NX-OS mode, Nexus 9500 R-Series Line Cards and Fabric Modules.
