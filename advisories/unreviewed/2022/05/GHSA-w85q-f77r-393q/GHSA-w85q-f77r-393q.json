  "details": "Norton Remove & Reinstall can be susceptible to a DLL preloading vulnerability. These types of issues occur when an application looks to call a DLL for execution and an attacker provides a malicious DLL to use instead. Depending on how the application is configured, it will generally follow a specific search path to locate the DLL. The vulnerability can be exploited by a simple file write (or potentially an over-write) which results in a foreign DLL running under the context of the application. A Norton Remove & Reinstall update, version 4.4.0.58, has been released which addresses the aforementioned vulnerability.",
