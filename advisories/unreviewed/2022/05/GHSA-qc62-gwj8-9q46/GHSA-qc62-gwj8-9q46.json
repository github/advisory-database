  "details": "A vulnerability in role-based access control (RBAC) for Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute CLI commands that should be restricted for a nonadministrative user. The attacker would have to possess valid user credentials for the device. The vulnerability is due to incorrect RBAC privilege assignment for certain CLI commands. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to a device as a nonadministrative user and executing specific commands from the CLI. An exploit could allow the attacker to run commands that should be restricted to administrative users. These commands could modify the configuration or boot image on the device. This vulnerability affects MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Switches, Nexus 2000 Series Switches, Nexus 3000 Series Switches, Nexus 3500 Platform Switches, Nexus 3600 Platform Switches, Nexus 5500 Platform Switches, Nexus 5600 Platform Switches, Nexus 6000 Series Switches, Nexus 7000 Series Switches, Nexus 7700 Series Switches, Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode, Nexus 9500 R-Series Line Cards and Fabric Modules.
