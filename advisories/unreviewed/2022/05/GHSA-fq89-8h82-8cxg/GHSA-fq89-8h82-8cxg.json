  "details": "spread uses a temporary file with a static filename based on the port number, which allows local users to cause a denial of service by creating the file during a race condition between unlink and bind function calls.  NOTE: spread deletes this temporary file before use, which could cause conflicts with other programs that use the same filename, but this is not a distinct issue.",
