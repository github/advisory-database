  "details": "On Juniper Networks Junos OS platforms configured as DHCPv6 local server or DHCPv6 Relay Agent, the Juniper Networks Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Daemon (JDHCPD) process might crash if a malformed DHCPv6 packet is received, resulting in a restart of the daemon. The daemon automatically restarts without intervention, but continued receipt and processing of this packet will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition. This issue only affects DHCPv6. DHCPv4 is not affected by this issue. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS: 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R3-S12; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R3-S5; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3-S13; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R3-S8; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R3-S5; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R1-S8, 18.4R3-S7; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R3-S5; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R3-S2; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R3-S2; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R3-S2; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R3; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R2-S3, 20.2R3; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R2; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R2.",
