  ],
  "details": "An Improper Privilege Management vulnerability in the gRPC framework, used by the Juniper Extension Toolkit (JET) API on Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved, allows a network-based, low-privileged authenticated attacker to perform operations as root, leading to complete compromise of the targeted system. The issue is caused by the JET service daemon (jsd) process authenticating the user, then passing configuration operations directly to the management daemon (mgd) process, which runs as root. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS: 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R1-S8, 18.4R2-S8, 18.4R3-S8; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R2-S3, 19.1R3-S5; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S7, 19.2R3-S2; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R2-S6, 19.3R3-S2; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R1-S4, 19.4R2-S4, 19.4R3-S3; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R2-S2, 20.1R3; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R2-S3, 20.2R3; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R2-S1, 20.3R3; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R2. This issue does not affect Juniper Networks Junos OS versions prior to 18.4R1. Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved: All versions prior to 20.4R2-EVO; 21.1-EVO versions prior to 21.1R2-EVO.",
