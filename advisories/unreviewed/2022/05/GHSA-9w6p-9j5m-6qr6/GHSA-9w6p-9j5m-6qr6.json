  ],
  "details": "An issue was discovered on Mimosa Client Radios before 2.2.3. In the device's web interface, there is a page that allows an attacker to use an unsanitized GET parameter to download files from the device as the root user. The attacker can download any file from the device's filesystem. This can be used to view unsalted, MD5-hashed administrator passwords, which can then be cracked, giving the attacker full admin access to the device's web interface. This vulnerability can also be used to view the plaintext pre-shared key (PSK) for encrypted wireless connections, or to view the device's serial number (which allows an attacker to factory reset the device).",
