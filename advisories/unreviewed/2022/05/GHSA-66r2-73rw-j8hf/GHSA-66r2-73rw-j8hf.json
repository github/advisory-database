  "details": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Foxit Reader 8.2.0.2051. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the saveAs JavaScript function. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can lead to writing arbitrary files into attacker controlled locations. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-4518.",
