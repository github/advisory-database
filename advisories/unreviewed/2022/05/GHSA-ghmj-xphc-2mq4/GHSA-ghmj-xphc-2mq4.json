  ],
  "details": "The ProBot bot through 2021-02-08 for Discord might allow attackers to interfere with the intended purpose of the \"Send an image when a user joins the server\" feature (or possibly have unspecified other impact) because the uploader web service allows double extensions (such as .html.jpg) with the text/html content type. NOTE: there may not be cases in which an uploader web service is customer controlled; however, the nature of the issue has substantial interaction with customer controlled configuration.",
