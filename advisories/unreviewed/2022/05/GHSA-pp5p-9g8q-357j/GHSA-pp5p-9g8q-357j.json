  "details": "A vulnerability in the network stack of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on the affected device. The vulnerability is due to an issue with allocating and freeing memory buffers in the network stack. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted TCP streams to an affected device in a sustained way. A successful exploit could cause the network stack of an affected device to run out of available buffers, impairing operations of control plane and management plane protocols, resulting in a DoS condition. Note: This vulnerability can be triggered only by traffic that is destined to an affected device and cannot be exploited using traffic that transits an affected device. Nexus 1000V Switch for Microsoft Hyper-V is affected in versions prior to 5.2(1)SM3(2.1). Nexus 1000V Switch for VMware vSphere is affected in versions prior to 5.2(1)SV3(4.1a). Nexus 3000 Series Switches are affected in versions prior to 7.0(3)I7(6) and 9.2(2). Nexus 3500 Platform Switches are affected in versions prior to 6.0(2)A8(11), 7.0(3)I7(6), and 9.2(2). Nexus 3600 Platform Switches are affected in versions prior to 7.0(3)F3(5) and 9.2(2). Nexus 5500, 5600, and 6000 Series Switches are affected in versions prior to 7.1(5)N1(1b) and 7.3(5)N1(1).
