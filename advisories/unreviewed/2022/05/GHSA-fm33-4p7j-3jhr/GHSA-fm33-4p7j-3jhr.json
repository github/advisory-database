  "details": "In ArangoDB, versions v2.2.6.2 through v3.7.10 are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), since there is no validation of the .zip file name and filtering of potential abusive characters which zip files can be named to. There is no X-Frame-Options Header set, which makes it more susceptible for leveraging self XSS by attackers.",
