  ],
  "details": "The FPC (Flexible PIC Concentrator) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved may restart after processing a specific IPv4 packet. Only packets destined to the device itself, successfully reaching the RE through existing edge and control plane filtering, will be able to cause the FPC restart. When this issue occurs, all traffic via the FPC will be dropped. By continuously sending this specific IPv4 packet, an attacker can repeatedly crash the FPC, causing an extended Denial of Service (DoS) condition. This issue can only occur when processing a specific IPv4 packet. IPv6 packets cannot trigger this issue. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series with MPC10E or MPC11E and PTX10001: 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S4, 19.2R2; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R2-S2, 19.3R3; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R1-S1, 19.4R2. Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved on on QFX5220, and PTX10003 series: 19.2-EVO versions; 19.3-EVO versions; 19.4-EVO versions prior to 19.4R2-EVO. This issue does not affect Junos OS versions prior to 19.2R1. This issue does not affect Junos OS Evolved versions prior to 19.2R1-EVO.",
