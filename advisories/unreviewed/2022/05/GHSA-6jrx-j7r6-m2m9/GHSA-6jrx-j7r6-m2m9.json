  "details": "SPBBCDrv.sys in Symantec Norton Personal Firewall 2006 9.1.0.33 and 9.1.1.7 does not validate certain arguments before being passed to hooked SSDT function handlers, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted arguments to the (1) NtCreateMutant and (2) NtOpenEvent functions.  NOTE: it was later reported that Norton Internet Security 2008 15.0.0.60, and possibly other versions back to 2006, are also affected.",
