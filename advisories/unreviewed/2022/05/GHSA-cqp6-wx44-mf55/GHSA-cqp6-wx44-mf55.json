  "details": "e107 0.75 and earlier does not properly unset variables when the input data includes a numeric parameter with a value matching an alphanumeric parameter's hash value, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via the tinyMCE_imglib_include image/jpeg parameter in e107_handlers/tiny_mce/plugins/ibrowser/ibrowser.php, as demonstrated by a multipart/form-data request.  NOTE: it could be argued that this vulnerability is due to a bug in the unset PHP command (CVE-2006-3017) and the proper fix should be in PHP; if so, then this should not be treated as a vulnerability in e107.",
