  "details": "An exploitable integer truncation vulnerability exists within the MPEG-4 decoding functionality of the GPAC Project on Advanced Content library v1.0.1. A specially crafted MPEG-4 input can cause an improper memory allocation resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow that causes memory corruption. The FOURCC code, 'trik', is parsed by the function within the library. An attacker can convince a user to open a video to trigger this vulnerability.",
