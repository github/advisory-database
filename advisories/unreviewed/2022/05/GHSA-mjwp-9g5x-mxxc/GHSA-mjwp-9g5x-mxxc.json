An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need valid agent credentials.\n ",
