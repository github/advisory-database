  "details": "A vulnerability in the Zone-Based Firewall code of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a device to reload. The vulnerability is due to the way fragmented packets are handled in the firewall code. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending fragmented IP Version 4 or IP Version 6 packets through an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to crash, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The following releases of Cisco IOS XE Software are vulnerable: Everest-16.4.1, Everest-16.4.2, Everest-16.5.1, Everest-16.5.1b, Everest-16.6.1, Everest-16.6.1a. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf60296.",
