The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of the affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to follow a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions on the targeted device via a web browser and with the privileges of the user. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvb19750.",
