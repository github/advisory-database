  "details": "An improper input validation vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (RPD) service of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an attacker to send a malformed RSVP packet when bidirectional LSPs are in use, which when received by an egress router crashes the RPD causing a Denial of Service (DoS) condition. Continued receipt of the packet will sustain the Denial of Service.
