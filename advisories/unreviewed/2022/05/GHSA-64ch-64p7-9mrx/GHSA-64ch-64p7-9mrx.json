  "details": "On Juniper Networks EX and QFX5K Series platforms configured with Redundant Trunk Group (RTG), Storm Control profile applied on the RTG interface might not take affect when it reaches the threshold condition. Storm Control enables the device to monitor traffic levels and to drop broadcast, multicast, and unknown unicast packets when a specified traffic level is exceeded, thus preventing packets from proliferating and degrading the LAN. Note: this issue does not affect EX2200, EX3300, EX4200, and EX9200 Series.
