  "details": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of the Cisco RV110W Wireless-N VPN Firewall, Cisco RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router, and Cisco RV215W Wireless-N VPN Router could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain access to sensitive information. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of directory traversal character sequences within the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious requests to the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain access to arbitrary files on the affected device, resulting in the disclosure of sensitive information.",
