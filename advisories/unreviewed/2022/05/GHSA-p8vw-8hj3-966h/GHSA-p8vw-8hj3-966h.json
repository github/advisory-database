  "details": "A vulnerability in the web framework of Cisco Small Business Managed Switches software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct an HTTP response splitting attack against a user of the web interface of an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of some parameters that are passed to the web server of the affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user to follow a malicious link or by intercepting a user request and injecting malicious code into the request. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected web interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information. This vulnerability affects the following Cisco Small Business 300 and 500 Series Managed Switches: Cisco 350 Series Managed Switches, Cisco 350X Series Stackable Managed Switches, Cisco 550X Series Stackable Managed Switches, Cisco ESW2 Series Advanced Switches, Cisco Small Business 300 Series Managed Switches, Cisco Small Business 500 Series Stackable Managed Switches.
