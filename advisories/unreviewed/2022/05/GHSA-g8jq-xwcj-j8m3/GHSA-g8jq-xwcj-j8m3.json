  "details": "A vulnerability in the web-based Local Manager interface of the Cisco IOx Application Framework could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based Local Manager interface of an affected device. The attacker must have valid Local Manager credentials. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based Local Manager interface of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious code into a system settings tab. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected web interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information.",
