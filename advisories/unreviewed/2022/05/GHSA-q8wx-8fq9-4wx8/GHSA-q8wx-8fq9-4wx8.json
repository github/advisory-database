  "details": "** DISPUTED ** Riverbed RiOS through 9.6.0 does not require a bootloader password, which makes it easier for physically proximate attackers to defeat the secure-vault protection mechanism via a crafted boot. NOTE: the vendor believes that this does not meet the definition of a vulnerability. The product contains correct computational logic for a bootloader password; however, this password is optional to meet different customers' needs.",
