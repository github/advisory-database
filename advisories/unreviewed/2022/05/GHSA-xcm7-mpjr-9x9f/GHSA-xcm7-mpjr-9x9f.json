One can put PHP code into the image; PHP code can be executed using \"<? ?>\" tags, as demonstrated by a CompanyDetailsSave action. This bypasses the bad-file-extensions protection mechanism. It is related to actions/CompanyDetailsSave.php, actions/UpdateCompanyLogo.php, and models/CompanyDetails.php.",
