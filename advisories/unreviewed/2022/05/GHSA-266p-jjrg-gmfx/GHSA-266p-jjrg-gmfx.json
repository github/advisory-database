  "details": "** DISPUTED ** The GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library (GMP) interfaces for PHP through 7.1.4 allow attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption and application crash) via operations on long strings. NOTE: the vendor disputes this, stating \"There is no security issue here, because GMP safely aborts in case of an OOM condition. The only attack vector here is denial of service. However, if you allow attacker-controlled, unbounded allocations you have a DoS vector regardless of GMP's OOM behavior.\"",
