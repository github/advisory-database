Specifically: all Microsoft Windows (also WinCE) based CODESYS web servers running stand-alone Version 2.3, or as part of the CODESYS runtime system running prior to Version V1.1.9.19. A crafted request may cause a buffer overflow and could therefore execute arbitrary code on the web server or lead to a denial-of-service condition due to a crash in the web server.",
