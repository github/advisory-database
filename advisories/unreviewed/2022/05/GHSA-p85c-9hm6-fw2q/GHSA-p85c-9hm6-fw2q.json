  "details": "The csrf_callback function in the CSRF Magic library through 2016-03-27 is vulnerable to CSRF protection bypass as it allows one to tamper with the csrf token values. A remote attacker can exploit this by crafting a malicious page and dispersing it to a victim via social engineering, enticing them to click the link. Once the user/victim clicks the \"try again\" button, the attacker can take over the account and perform unintended actions on the victim's behalf.",
