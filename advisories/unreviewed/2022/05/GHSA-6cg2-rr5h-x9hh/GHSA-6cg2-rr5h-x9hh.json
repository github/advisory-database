  "details": "The Filebird Plugin 4.7.3 introduced a SQL injection vulnerability as it is making SQL queries without escaping user input data from a HTTP post request. This is a major vulnerability as the user input is not escaped and passed directly to the get_col function and it allows SQL injection. The Rest API endpoint which invokes this function also does not have any required permissions/authentication and can be accessed by an anonymous user.",
