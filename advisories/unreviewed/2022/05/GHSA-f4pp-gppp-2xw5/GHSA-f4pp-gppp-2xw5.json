  "details": "Zyxel P2000W Version 1 VOIP WIFI Phone Wj.00.10 uses hardcoded IP addresses for its DNS servers, which could allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service or hijack Zyxel phones by attacking or spoofing the hardcoded DNS servers.  NOTE: it could be argued that this issue reflects an inherent limitation of DNS itself, so perhaps it should not be included in CVE.",
