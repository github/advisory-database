  "details": "The administrator application on ASUS GT-AC2900 devices before 3.0.0.4.386.42643 allows authentication bypass when processing remote input from an unauthenticated user, leading to unauthorized access to the administrator interface. This relates to handle_request in router/httpd/httpd.c and auth_check in web_hook.o. An attacker-supplied value of '\\0' matches the device's default value of '\\0' in some situations.",
