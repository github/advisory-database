This vulnerability is due to improper validation of URL paths in the application interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to follow a specially crafted URL that is designed to cause Cisco Webex Meetings to include a remote file in the web UI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the application to offer a remote file to a user, which could allow the attacker to conduct further phishing or spoofing attacks.",
