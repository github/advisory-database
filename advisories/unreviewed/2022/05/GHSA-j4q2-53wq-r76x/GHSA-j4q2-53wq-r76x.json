  ],
  "details": "An exploitable uninitialized length vulnerability exists within the Word document-parser of the Atlantis Word Processor 3.0.2.3 and 3.0.2.5. A specially crafted document can cause Atlantis to skip initializing a value representing the number of columns of a table. Later, the application will use this as a length within a loop that will write to a pointer on the heap. Due to this value being controlled, a buffer overflow will occur, which can lead to code execution under the context of the application. An attacker must convince a victim to open a document in order to trigger this vulnerability.",
