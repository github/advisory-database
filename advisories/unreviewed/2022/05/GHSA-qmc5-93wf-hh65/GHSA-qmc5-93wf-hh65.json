  "details": "Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in Download-Engine 1.4.2 and earlier allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the (1) $_ENGINE[eng_dir] and possibly (2) spaw_root parameters in admin/includes/spaw/spaw_script.js.php, and the (3) $_ENGINE[eng_dir], (4) $spaw_root, (5) $spaw_dir, and (6) $spaw_base_url parameters in admin/includes/spaw/config/spaw_control.config.php, different vectors than CVE-2006-5291.  NOTE: CVE analysis as of 20061021 is inconclusive, but suggests that some or all of the suggested attack vectors are ineffective.",
