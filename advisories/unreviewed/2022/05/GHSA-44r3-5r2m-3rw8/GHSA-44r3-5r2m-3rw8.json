  "details": "On Juniper Networks Junos OS devices configured with DHCPv6 relay enabled, receipt of a specific DHCPv6 packet might crash the jdhcpd daemon. The jdhcpd daemon automatically restarts without intervention, but continuous receipt of specific crafted DHCP messages will repeatedly crash jdhcpd, leading to an extended Denial of Service (DoS) condition. Only DHCPv6 packet can trigger this issue. DHCPv4 packet cannot trigger this issue. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS: 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R3-S9; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R2-S11, 17.4R3-S2, 17.4R3-S3; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3-S11; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R3-S5; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R2-S4, 18.3R3-S3; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S5, 18.4R3-S4; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R2-S2, 19.1R3-S2; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S5, 19.2R2-S1, 19.2R3; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R2-S4, 19.3R2-S4, 19.3R3; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R1-S3, 19.4R2-S1, 19.4R3; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R1-S3, 20.1R2.",
