  ],
  "details": "A vulnerability in the Extensible Authentication Protocol-Transport Layer Security (EAP-TLS) certificate validation during EAP authentication for the Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the ISE application server to restart unexpectedly, causing a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to incomplete input validation of the client EAP-TLS certificate. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by initiating EAP authentication over TLS to the ISE with a crafted EAP-TLS certificate. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to restart the ISE application server, resulting in a DoS condition on the affected system. The ISE application could continue to restart while the client attempts to establish the EAP authentication connection. If an attacker attempted to import the same EAP-TLS certificate to the ISE trust store, it could trigger a DoS condition on the affected system. This exploit vector would require the attacker to have valid administrator credentials. The vulnerability affects Cisco ISE, Cisco ISE Express, and Cisco ISE Virtual Appliance.
