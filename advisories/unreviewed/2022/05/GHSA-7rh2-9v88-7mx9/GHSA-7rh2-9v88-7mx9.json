  "details": "Zimbra before 8.8.15 Patch 10 and 9.x before 9.0.0 Patch 3 allows remote code execution via an avatar file. There is potential abuse of /service/upload servlet in the webmail subsystem. A user can upload executable files (exe,sh,bat,jar) in the Contact section of the mailbox as an avatar image for a contact. A user will receive a \"Corrupt File\" error, but the file is still uploaded and stored locally in /opt/zimbra/data/tmp/upload/, leaving it open to possible remote execution.",
