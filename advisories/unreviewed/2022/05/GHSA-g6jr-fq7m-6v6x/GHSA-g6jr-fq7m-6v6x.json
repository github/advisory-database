  ],
  "details": "A vulnerability in the SSH CLI key management functionality of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to expose a user's private SSH key to all authenticated users on the targeted device. The attacker must authenticate with valid administrator device credentials. The vulnerability is due to incomplete error handling if a specific error type occurs during the SSH key export. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device and entering a crafted command at the CLI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to expose a user's private SSH key. In addition, a similar type of error in the SSH key import could cause the passphrase-protected private SSH key to be imported unintentionally.",
