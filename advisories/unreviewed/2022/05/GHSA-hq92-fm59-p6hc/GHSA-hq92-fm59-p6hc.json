  "details": "A vulnerability in the NX-API feature of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges. The vulnerability is due to incorrect input validation of user-supplied data by the NX-API subsystem. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious HTTP or HTTPS packets to the management interface of an affected system that has the NX-API feature enabled. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform a command-injection attack and execute arbitrary commands with root privileges. Note: NX-API is disabled by default. MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Switches are affected running software versions prior to 8.1(1b) and 8.2(3). Nexus 3000 Series Switches are affected running software versions prior to 7.0(3)I4(9) and 7.0(3)I7(4). Nexus 3500 Platform Switches are affected running software versions prior to 7.0(3)I7(4). Nexus 2000, 5500, 5600, and 6000 Series Switches are affected running software versions prior to 7.3(4)N1(1). Nexus 9000 Series Switches in Standalone NX-OS Mode are affected running software versions prior to 7.0(3)I4(9) and 7.0(3)I7(4). Nexus 7000 and 7700 Series Switches are affected running software versions prior to 7.3(3)D1(1) and 8.2(3).",
