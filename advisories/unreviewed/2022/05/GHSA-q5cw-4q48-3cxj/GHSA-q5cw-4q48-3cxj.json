  "details": "Re:Desk 2.3 contains a blind unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability in the getBaseCriteria() function in the protected/models/Ticket.php file. By modifying the folder GET parameter, it is possible to execute arbitrary SQL statements via a crafted URL. Unauthenticated remote command execution is possible by using this SQL injection to update certain database values, which are then executed by a bizRule eval() function in the yii/framework/web/auth/CAuthManager.php file. Resultant authorization bypass is also possible, by recovering or modifying password hashes and password reset tokens, allowing for administrative privileges to be obtained.",
