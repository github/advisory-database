  "details": "The MXQ TV Box 4.4.2 Android device with a build fingerprint of MBX/m201_N/m201_N:4.4.2/KOT49H/20160106:user/test-keys contains the Android framework with a package name of android (versionCode=19, versionName=4.4.2-20170213) that dynamically registers a broadcast receiver app component named com.android.server.MasterClearReceiver instead of statically registering it in the AndroidManifest.xml file of the core Android package, as done in Android Open Source Project (AOSP) code for Android 4.4.2. The dynamic-registration of the MasterClearReceiver broadcast receiver app component is not protected with the android.permission.MASTER_CLEAR permission during registration, so any app co-located on the device, even those without any permissions, can programmatically initiate a factory reset of the device. A factory reset will remove all user data and apps from the device. This will result in the loss of any data that have not been backed up or synced externally. The capability to perform a factory reset is not directly available to third-party apps (those that the user installs themselves with the exception of enabled Mobile Device Management (MDM) apps), although this capability can be obtained by leveraging an unprotected app component of core Android process.",
