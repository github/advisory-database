  "details": "A malicious Android application could craft an Intent that would have been processed by Firefox for Android and potentially result in a file overwrite in the user's profile directory. One exploitation vector for this would be to supply a user.js file providing arbitrary malicious preference values. Control of arbitrary preferences can lead to sufficient compromise such that it is generally equivalent to arbitrary code execution.<br> *Note: This issue only affects Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 68.7.",
