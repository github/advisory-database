The vulnerability is due to the improper handling of SIP request messages by an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed SIP messages to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to become unresponsive, resulting in a DoS condition that persists until the device is restarted manually. This vulnerability affects Cisco Small Business SPA51x Series IP Phones that are running Cisco SPA51x Firmware Release 7.6.2SR1 or earlier. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvc63982.",
