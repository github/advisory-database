  "details": "The XSS Filter in Microsoft Internet Explorer 8.0 Beta 2 does not properly handle some HTTP headers that appear after a CRLF sequence in a URI, which allows remote attackers to bypass the XSS protection mechanism and conduct XSS or redirection attacks, as demonstrated by the (1) Location and (2) Set-Cookie HTTP headers.  NOTE: the vendor has reportedly stated that the XSS Filter intentionally does not attempt to \"address every conceivable XSS attack scenario.\"",
