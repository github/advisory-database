  "details": "Hawking Technology wireless router WR254-CA uses a hardcoded IP address among the set of DNS server IP addresses, which could allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service or hijack the router by attacking or spoofing the server at the hardcoded address.  NOTE: it could be argued that this issue reflects an inherent limitation of DNS itself, so perhaps it should not be included in CVE.",
