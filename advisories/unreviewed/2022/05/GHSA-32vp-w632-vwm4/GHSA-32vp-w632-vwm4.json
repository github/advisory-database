  "details": "The Dual_EC_DRBG implementation in EMC RSA BSAFE-C Toolkits (aka Share for C and C++) processes certain requests for output bytes by considering only the requested byte count and not the use of cached bytes, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain plaintext from TLS sessions by recovering the algorithm's inner state, a different issue than CVE-2007-6755.",
