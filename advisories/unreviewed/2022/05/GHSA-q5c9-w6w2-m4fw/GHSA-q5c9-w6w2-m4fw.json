  "details": "A vulnerability has been identified in SCALANCE XM-400 Family (All versions < V6.4), SCALANCE XR-500 Family (All versions < V6.4). The OSPF protocol implementation in affected devices incorrectly handles the number of LSA fields in combination with other modified fields. An unauthenticated remote attacker could create a permanent denial-of-service condition by sending specially crafted OSPF packets. Successful exploitation requires OSPF to be enabled on an affected device.",
