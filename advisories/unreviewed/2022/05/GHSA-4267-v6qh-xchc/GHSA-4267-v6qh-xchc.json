  "details": "** DISPUTED ** The wsdl_first_https sample code in distribution/src/main/release/samples/wsdl_first_https/src/main/ in Apache CXF before 2.7.0 does not verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via an arbitrary valid certificate. NOTE: The vendor states that the sample had specifically used a flag to bypass the DN check.",
