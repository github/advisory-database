  "details": "Code42 environments with on-premises server versions 7.0.4 and earlier allow for possible remote code execution. When an administrator creates a local (non-SSO) user via a Code42-generated email, the administrator has the option to modify content for the email invitation. If the administrator entered template language code in the subject line, that code could be interpreted by the email generation services, potentially resulting in server-side code injection.",
