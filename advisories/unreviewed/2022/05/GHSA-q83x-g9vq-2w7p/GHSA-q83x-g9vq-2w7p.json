  "details": "A vulnerability in Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to gain access to sensitive information. This vulnerability is due to improper access controls on API endpoints when Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software is running in multi-tenant mode. An attacker with access to a device that is managed in the multi-tenant environment could exploit this vulnerability by sending a request to an affected API endpoint on the vManage system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain access to sensitive information that may include hashed credentials that could be used in future attacks.",
