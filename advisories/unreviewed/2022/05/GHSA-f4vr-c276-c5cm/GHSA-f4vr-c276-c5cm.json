This type of attack is commonly referred to as server-side request forgery (SSRF). The vulnerability is due to insufficient access controls for the REST API of Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence VCS. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted HTTP request to the affected server. Versions prior to XC4.3.4 are affected.",
