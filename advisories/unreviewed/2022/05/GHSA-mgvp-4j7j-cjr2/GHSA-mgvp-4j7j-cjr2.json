  "details": "** DISPUTED **  PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in contrib/yabbse/poc.php in phpopenchat before 3.0.2 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via the sourcedir parameter.  NOTE: this issue was disputed by a third-party researcher who stated that the _REQUEST parameters were dynamically unset at the beginning of the file.  Another researcher noted, and CVE agrees, that the unset PHP function can be bypassed (CVE-2006-3017).  If this issue is due to a vulnerability in PHP, then it should be excluded from CVE.",
