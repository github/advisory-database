  "details": "An authentication-bypass issue was discovered on D-Link DAP-1522 devices 1.4x before 1.10b04Beta02. There exist a few pages that are directly accessible by any unauthorized user, e.g., logout.php and login.php. This occurs because of checking the value of NO_NEED_AUTH. If the value of NO_NEED_AUTH is 1, the user has direct access to the webpage without any authentication. By appending a query string NO_NEED_AUTH with the value of 1 to any protected URL, any unauthorized user can access the application directly, as demonstrated by bsc_lan.php?NO_NEED_AUTH=1.",
