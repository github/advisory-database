  "details": "A vulnerability in Junos OS SNMP MIB-II subagent daemon (mib2d) may allow a remote network based attacker to cause the mib2d process to crash resulting in a denial of service condition (DoS) for the SNMP subsystem. While a mib2d process crash can disrupt the network monitoring via SNMP, it does not impact routing, switching or firewall functionalities. SNMP is disabled by default on devices running Junos OS. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS: 12.1X46 versions prior to 12.1X46-D76; 12.3 versions prior to 12.3R12-S7, 12.3R13; 12.3X48 versions prior to 12.3X48-D65; 14.1 versions prior to 14.1R9; 14.1X53 versions prior to 14.1X53-D130; 15.1 versions prior to 15.1F2-S20, 15.1F6-S10, 15.1R7; 15.1X49 versions prior to 15.1X49-D130; 15.1X53 versions prior to 15.1X53-D233, 15.1X53-D471, 15.1X53-D472, 15.1X53-D58, 15.1X53-D66; 16.1 versions prior to 16.1R5-S3, 16.1R7; 16.1X65 versions prior to 16.1X65-D47; 16.1X70 versions prior to 16.1X70-D10; 16.2 versions prior to 16.2R1-S6, 16.2R2-S5, 16.2R3; 17.1 versions prior to 17.1R2-S6, 17.1R3;",
