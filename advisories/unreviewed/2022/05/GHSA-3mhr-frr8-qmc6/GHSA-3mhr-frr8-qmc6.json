The vulnerability is due to incorrect management of the configured interface names and VPN parameters when dynamic CLI configuration changes are performed. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending packets through an interface on the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass configured VPN policies.
