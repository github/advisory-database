  "details": "An issue was discovered in Ivanti Workspace Control 10.3.110.0. One is able to bypass Ivanti's FileGuard folder protection by renaming the WMTemp work folder used by PowerGrid. A malicious PowerGrid XML file can then be created, after which the folder is renamed back to its original value. Also, CVE-2018-15591 exploitation can consequently be achieved by using PowerGrid with the /SEE parameter to execute the arbitrary command specified in the XML file.",
