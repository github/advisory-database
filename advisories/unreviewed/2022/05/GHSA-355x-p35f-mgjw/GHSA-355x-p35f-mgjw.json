  "details": "The Leagoo Z5C Android device with a build fingerprint of sp7731c_1h10_32v4_bird:6.0/MRA58K/android.20170629.214736:user/release-keys contains a pre-installed app with a package name of com.android.messaging (versionCode=1000110, versionName=1.0.001, (android.20170630.092853-0)) containing an exported content provider named com.android.messaging.datamodel.MessagingContentProvider. Any app co-located on the device can read the most recent text message from each conversation. That is, for each phone number where the user has either sent or received a text message from, a zero-permission third-party app can obtain the body of the text message, phone number, name of the contact (if it exists), and a timestamp for the most recent text message of each conversation. As the querying of the vulnerable content provider app component can be performed silently in the background, a malicious app can continuously monitor the content provider to see if the current message in each conversation has changed to obtain new text messages.",
