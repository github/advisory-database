  ],
  "details": "Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved fail to drop/discard delayed MACsec packets (e.g. delayed by more than 2 seconds). Per the specification, called the \"bounded receive delay\", there should be no replies to delayed MACsec packets. Any MACsec traffic delayed more than 2 seconds should be dropped and late drop counters should increment. Without MACsec delay protection, an attacker could exploit the delay to spoof or decrypt packets. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS: 16.1 versions prior to 16.1R7-S8; 17.2 versions prior to 17.2R3-S4; 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R3-S8, 17.3R3-S9; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R2-S11, 17.4R3-S2; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3-S11; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R3-S5; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R2-S4, 18.3R3-S3; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R1-S7, 18.4R2-S5, 18.4R3-S3; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R3-S2; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S5, 19.2R3; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R2-S3, 19.3R3; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R1-S2, 19.4R2-S1, 19.4R3; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R1-S2, 20.1R2. Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved: all versions prior to 19.4R3-EVO; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R2-EVO. This issue does not affect Junos OS versions prior to 16.1R1.",
