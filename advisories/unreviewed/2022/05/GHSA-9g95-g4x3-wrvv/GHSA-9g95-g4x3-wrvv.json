  "details": "On certain Samsung P(9.0) phones, an attacker with physical access can start a TCP Dump capture without the user's knowledge. This feature of the Service Mode application is available after entering the *#9900# check code, but is protected by an OTP password. However, this password is created locally and (due to mishandling of cryptography) can be obtained easily by reversing the password creation logic.",
