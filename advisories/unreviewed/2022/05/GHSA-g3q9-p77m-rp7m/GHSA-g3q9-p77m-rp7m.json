  "details": "BigProf Online Invoicing System before 4.0 fails to adequately sanitize fields for HTML characters upon an administrator using admin/pageEditGroup.php to create a new group, resulting in Stored XSS. The caveat here is that an attacker would need administrative privileges in order to create the payload. One might think this completely mitigates the privilege-escalation impact as there is only one high-privileged role. However, it was discovered that the endpoint responsible for creating the group lacks CSRF protection.",
