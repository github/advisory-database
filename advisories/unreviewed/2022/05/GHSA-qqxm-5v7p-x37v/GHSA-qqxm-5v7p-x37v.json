  "details": "The Oracle WebCenter Interaction 10.3.3 search service queryd.exe binary is compiled with the i1g2s3c4 hardcoded password. Authentication to the Oracle WCI search service uses this hardcoded password and cannot be customised by customers. An adversary able to access this service over a network could perform search queries to extract large quantities of sensitive information from the WCI installation. NOTE: this CVE is assigned by MITRE and isn't validated by Oracle because Oracle WebCenter Interaction Portal is out of support.",
