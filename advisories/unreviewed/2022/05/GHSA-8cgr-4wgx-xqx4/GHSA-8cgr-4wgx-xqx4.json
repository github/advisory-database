  "details": "The random() function of the smart contract implementation for CryptoSaga, an Ethereum game, generates a random value with publicly readable variables such as timestamp, the current block's blockhash, and a private variable (which can be read with a getStorageAt call). Therefore, attackers can precompute the random number and manipulate the game (e.g., get powerful characters or get critical damages).",
