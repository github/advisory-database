  "details": "Receipt of a specific MPLS packet may cause the routing protocol daemon (RPD) process to crash and restart or may lead to remote code execution. By continuously sending specific MPLS packets, an attacker can repeatedly crash the RPD process causing a sustained Denial of Service. This issue affects both IPv4 and IPv6. This issue can only be exploited from within the MPLS domain. End-users connected to the CE device cannot cause this crash.
