  "details": "Dolibarr before 11.0.5 allows low-privilege users to upload files of dangerous types, leading to arbitrary code execution. This occurs because .pht and .phar files can be uploaded. Also, a .htaccess file can be uploaded to reconfigure access control (e.g., to let .noexe files be executed as PHP code to defeat the .noexe protection mechanism).",
