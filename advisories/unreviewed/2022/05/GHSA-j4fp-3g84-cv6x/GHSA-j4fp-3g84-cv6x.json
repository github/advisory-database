  "details": "An issue was discovered in a smart contract implementation for Virgo_ZodiacToken, an Ethereum token. In this contract, 'bool sufficientAllowance = allowance <= _value' will cause an arbitrary transfer in the function transferFrom because '<=' is used instead of '>=' (which was intended). An attacker can transfer from any address to his address, and does not need to meet the 'allowance > value' condition.",
