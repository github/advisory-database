  "details": "An issue was discovered in Kaseya Virtual System Administrator (VSA) through 9.4.0.37. It has a critical information disclosure vulnerability. An unauthenticated attacker can send properly formatted requests to the web application and download sensitive files and information. For example, the /DATAREPORTS directory can be farmed for reports. Because this directory contains the results of reports such as NMAP, Patch Status, and Active Directory domain metadata, an attacker can easily collect this critical information and parse it for information. There are a number of directories affected.",
