  ],
  "details": "A vulnerability in the FindMe feature of Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack and perform arbitrary actions on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of the affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to follow a maliciously crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions on an affected system with the privileges of the user. The arbitrary actions include adding an attacker-controlled device and redirecting calls intended for a specific user. For more information about CSRF attacks and potential mitigations, see Understanding Cross-Site Request Forgery Threat Vectors. This vulnerability is fixed in software version X12.5.1 and later.",
