  ],
  "details": "When booting a Zync-7000 SOC device from nand flash memory, the nand driver in the ROM does not validate the inputs when reading in any parameters in the nand’s parameter page. IF a field read in from the parameter page is too large, this causes a buffer overflow that could lead to arbitrary code execution. Physical access and modification to the Zynq-7000 device is needed to replace the original nand flash memory with a nand flash emulator for this attack to be successful.",
