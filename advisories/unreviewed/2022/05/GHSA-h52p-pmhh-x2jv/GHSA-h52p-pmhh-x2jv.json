  "details": "An issue was discovered in tcp_pulloutofband() in tcp_in.c in HCC embedded InterNiche 4.0.1. The TCP out-of-band urgent-data processing function invokes a panic function if the pointer to the end of the out-of-band data points outside of the TCP segment's data. If the panic function hadn't a trap invocation removed, it will enter an infinite loop and therefore cause DoS (continuous loop or a device reset).",
