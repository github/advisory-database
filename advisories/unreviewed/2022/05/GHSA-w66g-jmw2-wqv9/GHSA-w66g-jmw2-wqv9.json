  "details": "An issue was discovered in heinekingmedia StashCat through 1.7.5 for Android, through 0.0.80w for Web, and through 0.0.86 for Desktop. The logout mechanism does not check for authorization. Therefore, an attacker only needs to know the device ID. This causes a denial of service. This might be interpreted as a vulnerability in customer-controlled software, in the sense that the StashCat client side has no secure way to signal that it is ending a session and that data should be deleted.",
