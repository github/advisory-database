  "details": "In Android before 2018-04-05 or earlier security patch level on Qualcomm Snapdragon Mobile and Snapdragon Wear IPQ4019, MDM9206, MDM9607, MDM9635M, MDM9640, MDM9645, MSM8909W, SD 210/SD 212/SD 205, SD 400, SD 410/12, SD 615/16/SD 415, SD 800, and SD 810, the function tzbsp_pil_verify_sig() does not strictly check that the pointer to ELF and program headers and hash segment is within secure memory. It only checks that the address is not in non-secure memory. A given address range can overlap with both secure and non-secure regions - hence if such an address is passed in, it would not pass the non-secure range check, and would be considered valid by the function, even though that memory area could be modified by the non-secure side.",
