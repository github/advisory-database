  "details": "An issue was discovered in One Identity Password Manager 5.8. An attacker could enumerate valid answers for a user. It is possible for an attacker to detect a valid answer based on the HTTP response content, and reuse this answer later for a password reset on a chosen password. The enumeration is possible because, within the HTTP response content, WRONG ID is only returned when the answer is incorrect.",
