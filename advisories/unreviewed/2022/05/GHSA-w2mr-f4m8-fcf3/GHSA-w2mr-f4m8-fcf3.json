  "details": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to create arbitrary files on vulnerable installations of NetGain Systems Enterprise Manager 7.2.730 build 1034. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed. The specific flaw exists within the org.apache.jsp.u.jsp.db.save_005fimage_jsp servlet, which listens on TCP port 8081 by default. When parsing the id parameter, the process does not properly validate user-supplied data, which can allow for the upload of files. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of Administrator. Was ZDI-CAN-5117.",
