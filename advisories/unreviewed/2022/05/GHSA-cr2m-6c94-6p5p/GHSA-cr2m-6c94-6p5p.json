The vulnerability is due to improper cross-origin domain protections for the WebSocket protocol. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user to visit a malicious website designed to send requests to the affected application while the user is logged into the application with an active session cookie. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve policy or configuration information from the affected software and to perform another attack against the management console.
