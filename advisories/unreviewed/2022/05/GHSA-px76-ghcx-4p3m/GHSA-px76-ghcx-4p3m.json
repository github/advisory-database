  "details": "A vulnerability in the TCP throttling process for the GUI of the Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) 2.1(0.474) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device where the ISE GUI may fail to respond to new or established connection requests. The vulnerability is due to insufficient TCP rate limiting protection on the GUI. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending the affected device a high rate of TCP connections to the GUI. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the GUI to stop responding while the high rate of connections is in progress. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvc81803.",
