  "details": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Prime Access Registrar could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform a stored cross-site scripting attack on an affected system. This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not sufficiently validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious code into specific pages of the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need valid administrative credentials. Cisco expects to release software updates that address this vulnerability.",
