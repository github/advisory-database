The vulnerability is due to improper input validation of the parameters of an HTTP request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by intercepting a user's HTTP request and modifying it into a request that causes the web interface to redirect the user to a specific malicious URL. This type of vulnerability is known as an open redirect attack and is used in phishing attacks that get users to unknowingly visit malicious sites.",
