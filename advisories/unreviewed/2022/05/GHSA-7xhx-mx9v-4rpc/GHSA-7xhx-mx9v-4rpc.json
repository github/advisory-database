  "details": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to disclose sensitive information on vulnerable installations of Samsung Email Fixed in version 5.0.02.16. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the handling of file:/// URIs. The issue lies in the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can allow for reading arbitrary files. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to escalate privileges. Was ZDI-CAN-5329.",
