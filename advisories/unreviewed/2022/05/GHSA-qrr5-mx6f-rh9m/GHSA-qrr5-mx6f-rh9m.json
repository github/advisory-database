  ],
  "details": "Adobe Integrated Runtime (AIR, aka Apollo) allows context-dependent attackers to modify arbitrary files within an executing .air file (compiled AIR application) and perform cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, as demonstrated by an application that modifies an HTML file inside itself via JavaScript that uses an APPEND open operation and the writeUTFBytes function.  NOTE: this may be an intended consequence of the AIR permission model; if so, then perhaps this issue should not be included in CVE.",
