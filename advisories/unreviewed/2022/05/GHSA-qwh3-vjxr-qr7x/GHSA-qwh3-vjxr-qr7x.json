  "details": "Direct static code injection vulnerability in edit.php in ACal Calendar Project 2.2.5 allows authenticated users to execute arbitrary PHP code via (1) the edit=header value, which modifies header.php, or (2) the edit=footer value, which modifies footer.php.  NOTE: this issue might be resultant from the poor authentication as identified by CVE-2006-0182.  Since the design of the product allows the administrator to edit the code, perhaps this issue should not be included in CVE, except as a consequence of CVE-2006-0182.",
