  "details": "An issue was discovered in myStrom WiFi Switch V1 before 2.66, WiFi Switch V2 before 3.80, WiFi Switch EU before 3.80, WiFi Bulb before 2.58, WiFi LED Strip before 3.80, WiFi Button before 2.73, and WiFi Button Plus before 2.73. The SSL/TLS server certificate in the device to cloud communication was not verified by the device. As a result, an attacker in control of the network traffic of a device could have taken control of a device by intercepting and modifying commands issued from the server to the device in a Man-in-the-Middle attack. This included the ability to inject firmware update commands into the communication and cause the device to install maliciously modified firmware.",
