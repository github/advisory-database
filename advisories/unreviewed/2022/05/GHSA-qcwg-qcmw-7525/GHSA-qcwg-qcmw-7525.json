  "details": "** DISPUTED **  Cross-domain vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox allows remote attackers to access restricted information from other domains via an object tag with a data parameter that references a link on the attacker's originating site that specifies a Location HTTP header that references the target site, which then makes that content available through the outerHTML attribute of the object.  NOTE: this description was based on a report that has since been retracted by the original authors. The authors misinterpreted their test results. Other third parties also disputed the original report. Therefore, this is not a vulnerability. It is being assigned a candidate number to provide a clear indication of its status.",
