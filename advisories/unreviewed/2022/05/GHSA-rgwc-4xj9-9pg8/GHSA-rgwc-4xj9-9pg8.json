  "details": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inserting malicious code in certain sections of the interface that are visible to other users. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. An attacker would need valid administrator credentials to exploit this vulnerability.",
