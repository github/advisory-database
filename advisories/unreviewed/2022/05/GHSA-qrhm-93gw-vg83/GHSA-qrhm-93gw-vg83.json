  ],
  "details": "Incorrect username validation in the registration processes of CTFd through 2.2.2 allows a remote attacker to take over an arbitrary account after initiating a password reset. This is related to register() and reset_password() in auth.py. To exploit the vulnerability, one must register with a username similar to the admin, but with spaces inserted before and after the username. This will register the account with the same username as the admin. After a reset of the password for this new account, CTFd will reset the admin account's password due to the username collision.",
