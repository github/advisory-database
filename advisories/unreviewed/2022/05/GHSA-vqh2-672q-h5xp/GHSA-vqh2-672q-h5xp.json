  "details": "An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the rendering functionality of Nitro Pro 13.13.2.242 and 13.16.2.300. When drawing the contents of a page and selecting the stroke color from an 'ICCBased' colorspace, the application will read a length from the file and use it as a loop sentinel when writing data into the member of an object. Due to the object member being a buffer of a static size allocated on the heap, this can result in a heap-based buffer overflow. A specially crafted document must be loaded by a victim in order to trigger this vulnerability.",
