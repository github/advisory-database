  "details": "Chamilo LMS 1.11.8 and 2.x allows remote code execution through an lp_upload.php unauthenticated file upload feature. It extracts a ZIP archive before checking its content, and once it has been extracted, does not check files in a recursive way. This means that by putting a .php file in a folder and then this folder in a ZIP archive, the server will accept this file without any checks. Because one can access this file from the website, it is remote code execution. This is related to a scorm imsmanifest.xml file, the import_package function, and extraction in $courseSysDir.$newDir.",
