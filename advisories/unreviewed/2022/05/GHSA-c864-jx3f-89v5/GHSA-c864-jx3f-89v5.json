  ],
  "details": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the implementation of the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) feature in Cisco FXOS Software and Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerabilities are due to the improper parsing of LDAP packets by an affected device. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending an LDAP packet crafted using Basic Encoding Rules (BER) to an affected device. The LDAP packet must have a source IP address of an LDAP server configured on the targeted device. A successful exploit could cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. Firepower 4100 Series Next-Generation Firewalls are affected in versions prior to 2.0.1.201, 2.2.2.54, and 2.3.1.75. Firepower 9300 Security Appliances are affected in versions prior to 2.0.1.201, 2.2.2.54 and 2.3.1.75. MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Switches are affected in versions prior to 8.2(1). Nexus 3000 Series Switches are affected in versions prior to 7.0(3)I7(1). Nexus 3500 Platform Switches are affected in versions prior to 7.0(3)I7(2). Nexus 7000 and 7700 Series Switches are affected in versions prior to 8.2(1). Nexus 9000 Series Switches in Standalone NX-OS Mode are affected in versions prior to 7.0(3)I7(1). Cisco UCS 6200 and 6300 Fabric Interconnect devices are affected in versions prior to 3.2(2b).",
