  "details": "An issue was discovered in Svakom Siime Eye 14.1.00000001.3.330.0.0.3.14. By sending a set_params.cgi?telnetd=1&save=1&reboot=1 request to the webserver, it is possible to enable the telnet interface on the device. The telnet interface can then be used to obtain access to the device with root privileges via a reecam4debug default password. This default telnet password is the same across all Siime Eye devices. In order for the attack to be exploited, an attacker must be physically close in order to connect to the device's Wi-Fi access point.",
