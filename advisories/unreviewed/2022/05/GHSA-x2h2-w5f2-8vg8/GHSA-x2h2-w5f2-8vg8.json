  "details": "A vulnerability in virtualization channel messaging in Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App for Windows could allow a local attacker to execute arbitrary code on a targeted system. This vulnerability occurs when this app is deployed in a virtual desktop environment and using virtual environment optimization. This vulnerability is due to improper validation of messages processed by the Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App. A local attacker with limited privileges could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious messages to the affected software by using the virtualization channel interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to modify the underlying operating system configuration, which could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of a targeted user. Note: This vulnerability can be exploited only when Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App is in a virtual desktop environment on a hosted virtual desktop (HVD) and is configured to use the Cisco Webex Meetings virtual desktop plug-in for thin clients.",
