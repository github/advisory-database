  "details": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the user interface of Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to obtain restricted information from other Webex users. These vulnerabilities are due to improper input validation of parameters returned to the application from a web site. An attacker with a valid Webex account could exploit these vulnerabilities by persuading a user to follow a URL that is designed to return malicious path parameters to the affected software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain restricted information from other Webex users.",
