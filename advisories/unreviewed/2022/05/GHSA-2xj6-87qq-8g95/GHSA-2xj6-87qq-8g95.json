  "details": "An issue was discovered in the _send_secure_msg() function of Yubico yubihsm-shell through 2.0.3. The function does not correctly validate the embedded length field of an authenticated message received from the device. Out-of-bounds reads performed by aes_remove_padding() can crash the running process, depending on the memory layout. This could be used by an attacker to cause a client-side denial of service. The yubihsm-shell project is included in the YubiHSM 2 SDK product.",
