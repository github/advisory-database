  ],
  "details": "An improper use of a validation framework when processing incoming genuine BGP packets within Juniper Networks RPD (routing protocols process) daemon allows an attacker to crash RPD thereby causing a Denial of Service (DoS) condition. This framework requires these packets to be passed. By continuously sending any of these types of formatted genuine packets, an attacker can repeatedly crash the RPD process causing a sustained Denial of Service. Authentication to the BGP peer is not required. This issue can be initiated or propagated through eBGP and iBGP and can impact devices in either modes of use as long as the devices are configured to support the compromised framework and a BGP path is activated or active. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS 16.1 versions 16.1R7-S6 and later versions prior to 16.1R7-S8; 17.3 versions 17.3R2-S5, 17.3R3-S6 and later versions prior to 17.3R3-S8; 17.4 versions 17.4R2-S7, 17.4R3 and later versions prior to 17.4R2-S11, 17.4R3-S2; 18.1 versions 18.1R3-S7 and later versions prior to 18.1R3-S10; 18.2 versions 18.2R2-S6, 18.2R3-S2 and later versions prior to 18.2R2-S7, 18.2R3-S5; 18.2X75 versions 18.2X75-D12, 18.2X75-D32, 18.2X75-D33, 18.2X75-D51, 18.2X75-D60, 18.2X75-D411, 18.2X75-D420 and later versions prior to 18.2X75-D32, 18.2X75-D33, 18.2X75-D420, 18.2X75-D52, 18.2X75-D60, 18.2X75-D65, 18.2X75-D70;(*1) 18.3 versions 18.3R1-S6, 18.3R2-S3, 18.3R3 and later versions prior to 18.3R2-S4, 18.3R3-S2; 18.4 versions 18.4R1-S5, 18.4R2-S4, 18.4R3 and later versions prior to 18.4R1-S7, 18.4R2-S5, 18.4R3-S3(*2); 19.1 versions 19.1R1-S3, 19.1R2 and later versions prior to 19.1R1-S5, 19.1R2-S2, 19.1R3-S2; 19.2 versions 19.2R1-S2, 19.2R2 and later versions prior to 19.2R1-S5, 19.2R2, 19.2R3; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R2-S3, 19.3R3; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R1-S2, 19.4R2, 19.4R3; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R1-S1, 20.1R2.
