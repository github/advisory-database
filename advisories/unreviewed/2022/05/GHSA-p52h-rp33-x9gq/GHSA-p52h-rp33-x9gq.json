  "details": "The default SSH configuration in Rapid7 Nexpose hardware appliances shipped before June 2017 does not specify desired algorithms for key exchange and other important functions. As a result, it falls back to allowing ALL algorithms supported by the relevant version of OpenSSH and makes the installations vulnerable to a range of MITM, downgrade, and decryption attacks.",
