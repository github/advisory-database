  "details": "** DISPUTED **  Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in the Rssxt component for Joomla! (com_rssxt), possibly 2.0 Beta 1 or 1.0 and earlier, allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the mosConfig_absolute_path parameter in (1) pinger.php, (2) RPC.php, or (3) rssxt.php.  NOTE: another researcher has disputed this issue, saying that the attacker can not control this parameter.  In addition, as of 20060825, the original researcher has appeared to be unreliable with some other past reports.  CVE has not performed any followup analysis with respect to this issue.",
