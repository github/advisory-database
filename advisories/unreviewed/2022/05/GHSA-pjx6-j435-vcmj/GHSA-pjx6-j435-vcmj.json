  "details": "An issue was discovered in Backdrop CMS 1.14.x before 1.14.2. It doesn't sufficiently filter output when displaying file type descriptions created by administrators. An attacker could potentially craft a specialized description, then have an administrator execute scripting when viewing the list of file types, aka XSS. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role with the \"Administer file types\" permission.",
