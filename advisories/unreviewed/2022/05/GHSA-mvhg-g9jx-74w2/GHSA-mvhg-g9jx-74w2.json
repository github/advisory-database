  "details": "A remote code execution issue was discovered in the WooCommerce Products Filter (aka WOOF) plugin before 2.2.0 for WordPress, as demonstrated by the shortcode parameter in a woof_redraw_woof action. The plugin implemented a page redraw AJAX function accessible to anyone without any authentication. WordPress shortcode markup in the \"shortcode\" parameters would be evaluated. Normally unauthenticated users can't evaluate shortcodes as they are often sensitive.",
