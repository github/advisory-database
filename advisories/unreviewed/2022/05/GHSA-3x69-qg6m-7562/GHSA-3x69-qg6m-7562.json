  "details": "A vulnerability in the Cisco Fabric Services component of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause process crashes, which can result in a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of TCP packets when processed by the Cisco Fabric Services over IP (CFSoIP) feature. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious Cisco Fabric Services TCP packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause process crashes, resulting in a device reload and a DoS condition. Note: There are three distribution methods that can be configured for Cisco Fabric Services. This vulnerability affects only distribution method CFSoIP, which is disabled by default. See the Details section for more information.",
