  ],
  "details": "A vulnerability in the implementation of the Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) in Cisco IOS XE 3.2 through 16.5 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker using an x tunnel router to bypass authentication checks performed when registering an Endpoint Identifier (EID) to a Routing Locator (RLOC) in the map server/map resolver (MS/MR). The vulnerability is due to a logic error introduced via a code regression for the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specific valid map-registration requests, which will be accepted by the MS/MR even if the authentication keys do not match, to the affected software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to inject invalid mappings of EIDs to RLOCs in the MS/MR of the affected software. This vulnerability affects Cisco devices that are configured with LISP acting as an IPv4 or IPv6 map server. This vulnerability affects Cisco IOS XE Software release trains 3.9E and Everest 16.4.
