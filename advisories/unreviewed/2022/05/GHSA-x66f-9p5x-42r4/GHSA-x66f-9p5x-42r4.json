  ],
  "details": "On SRX Series devices, a vulnerability in the key-management-daemon (kmd) daemon of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an attacker to spoof packets targeted to IPSec peers before a security association (SA) is established thereby causing a failure to set up the IPSec channel. Sustained receipt of these spoofed packets can cause a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition. This issue affects IPv4 and IPv6 implementations. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series: 12.3X48 versions prior to 12.3X48-D90; 15.1X49 versions prior to 15.1X49-D190; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R2-S9, 17.4R3; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3-S9; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R3; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R1-S7, 18.3R2-S3, 18.3R3; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R1-S6, 18.4R2-S3, 18.4R3; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R1-S4, 19.1R2. This issue does not affect 12.3 or 15.1 releases which are non-SRX Series releases.",
