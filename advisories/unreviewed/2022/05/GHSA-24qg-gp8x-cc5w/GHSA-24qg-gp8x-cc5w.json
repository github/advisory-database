  "details": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on vulnerable installations of Samsung Email Fixed in version 5.0.02.16. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the handling of EML files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can allow arbitrary JavaScript to execute. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges to resources normally protected from the application. Was ZDI-CAN-5328.",
