  ],
  "details": "A vulnerability in the Secure Shell (SSH) authentication process of Cisco Small Business Switches software could allow an attacker to bypass client-side certificate authentication and revert to password authentication. The vulnerability exists because OpenSSH mishandles the authentication process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to connect to the device via SSH. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access the configuration as an administrative user if the default credentials are not changed. There are no workarounds available; however, if client-side certificate authentication is enabled, disable it and use strong password authentication. Client-side certificate authentication is disabled by default.",
