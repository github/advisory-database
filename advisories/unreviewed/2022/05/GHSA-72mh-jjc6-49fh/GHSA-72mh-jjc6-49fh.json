  "details": "** DISPUTED **  SQL injection vulnerability in Quantum Art QP7.Enterprise (formerly Q-Publishing) allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the p_news_id parameter to (1) news_and_events_new.asp and (2) news.asp.  NOTE: on 20060227, the vendor disputed the accuracy of this report, saying that the p_news_id, news_and_events_new.asp, and news.asp are not specifically part of their product, although they could be dynamically generated through use of the product.  Some investigation by CVE suggests evidence that the news_and_events_new.asp page has at least a forced invalid SQL syntax error, but this could not be repeated for news.asp.",
