  "details": "An issue was discovered on Xiaomi MIUI V11.0.5.0.QFAEUXM devices. In the Web resources of GetApps(com.xiaomi.mipicks), the parameters passed in are read and executed. After reading the resource files, relevant components open the link of the incoming URL. Although the URL is safe and can pass security detection, the data carried in the parameters are loaded and executed. An attacker can use NFC tools to get close enough to a user's unlocked phone to cause apps to be installed and information to be leaked. This is fixed on version: 2001122.",
