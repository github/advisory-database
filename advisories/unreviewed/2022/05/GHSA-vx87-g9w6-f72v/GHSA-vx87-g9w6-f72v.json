The vulnerability is caused by a computation that writes data past the end of the intended buffer; the computation is part of the XPS to PDF conversion module, when processing TIFF files. The vulnerability is a result of an out of range pointer offset that is used to access sub-elements of an internal data structure. An attacker can potentially leverage the vulnerability to corrupt sensitive data or execute arbitrary code.",
