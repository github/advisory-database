  "details": "It is possible to bypass the bitbucket auto-unapprove plugin via minimal brute-force because it is relying on asynchronous events on the back-end. This allows an attacker to merge any code into unsuspecting repositories. This affects all versions of the auto-unapprove plugin, however since the auto-unapprove plugin is not bundled with Bitbucket Server it does not affect any particular version of Bitbucket.",
