  "details": "HHVM does not attempt to address RFC 3875 section 4.1.18 namespace conflicts and therefore does not protect CGI applications from the presence of untrusted client data in the HTTP_PROXY environment variable, which might allow remote attackers to redirect a CGI application&#39;s outbound HTTP traffic to an arbitrary proxy server via a crafted Proxy header in an HTTP request, aka an &quot;httpoxy&quot; issue. This issue affects HHVM versions prior to 3.9.6, all versions between 3.10.0 and 3.12.4 (inclusive), and all versions between 3.13.0 and 3.14.2 (inclusive).",
