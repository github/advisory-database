  "details": "An issue was discovered in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) through 1.16. There is a variable \"dbentry->n_key_data\" in kadmin/dbutil/dump.c that can store 16-bit data but unknowingly the developer has assigned a \"u4\" variable to it, which is for 32-bit data. An attacker can use this vulnerability to affect other artifacts of the database as we know that a Kerberos database dump file contains trusted data.",
