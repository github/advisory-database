  "details": "An issue was discovered in Selesta Visual Access Manager (VAM) 4.15.0 through 4.29. A user with valid credentials is able to read XML files on the filesystem via the web interface. The PHP page /common/vam_editXml.php doesn't check the parameter that identifies the file name to be read. Thus, an attacker can manipulate the file name to access a potentially sensitive file within the filesystem.",
