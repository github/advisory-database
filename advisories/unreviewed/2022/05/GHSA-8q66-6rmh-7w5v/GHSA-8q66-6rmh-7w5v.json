  "details": "OpenKM 6.3.2 through 6.3.7 allows an attacker to upload a malicious JSP file into the /okm:root directories and move that file to the home directory of the site, via frontend/FileUpload and admin/repository_export.jsp. This is achieved by interfering with the Filesystem path control in the admin's Export field. As a result, attackers can gain remote code execution through the application server with root privileges.",
