  ],
  "details": "A hard-coded credentials issue was discovered on Mimosa Client Radios before 2.2.3, Mimosa Backhaul Radios before 2.2.3, and Mimosa Access Points before 2.2.3. These devices run Mosquitto, a lightweight message broker, to send information between devices. By using the vendor's hard-coded credentials to connect to the broker on any device (whether it be an AP, Client, or Backhaul model), an attacker can view all the messages being sent between the devices. If an attacker connects to an AP, the AP will leak information about any clients connected to it, including the serial numbers, which can be used to remotely factory reset the clients via a page in their web interface.",
