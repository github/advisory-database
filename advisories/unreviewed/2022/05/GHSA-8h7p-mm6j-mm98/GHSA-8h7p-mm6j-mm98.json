  "details": "An issue was discovered in DigDash 2018R2 before p20200210 and 2019R1 before p20200210. The login page is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) that allows use of the application as a proxy. Sent to an external server, a forged request discloses application credentials. For a request to an internal component, the request is blind, but through the error message it's possible to determine whether the request targeted a open service.",
