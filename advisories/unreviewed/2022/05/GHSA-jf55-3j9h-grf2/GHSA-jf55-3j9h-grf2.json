  "details": "** DISPUTED **  Sudo 1.6.8p7 on SuSE Linux 9.3, and possibly other Linux distributions, allows local users to gain privileges by using sudo to call su, then entering a blank password and hitting CTRL-C. NOTE: SuSE and multiple third-party researchers have not been able to replicate this issue, stating \"Sudo catches SIGINT and returns an empty string for the password so I don't see how this could happen unless the user's actual password was empty.\"",
