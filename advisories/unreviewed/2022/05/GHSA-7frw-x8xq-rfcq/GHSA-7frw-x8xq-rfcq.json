  "details": "Roxy Fileman 1.4.5 for .NET is vulnerable to path traversal. A remote attacker can write uploaded files to arbitrary locations via the RENAMEFILE action. This can be leveraged for code execution by uploading a specially crafted Windows shortcut file and writing the file to the Startup folder (because an incomplete blacklist of file extensions allows Windows shortcut files to be uploaded).",
