  "details": "** DISPUTED ** The scp client in OpenSSH 8.2 incorrectly sends duplicate responses to the server upon a utimes system call failure, which allows a malicious unprivileged user on the remote server to overwrite arbitrary files in the client's download directory by creating a crafted subdirectory anywhere on the remote server. The victim must use the command scp -rp to download a file hierarchy containing, anywhere inside, this crafted subdirectory. NOTE: the vendor points out that \"this attack can achieve no more than a hostile peer is already able to achieve within the scp protocol\" and \"utimes does not fail under normal circumstances.\"",
