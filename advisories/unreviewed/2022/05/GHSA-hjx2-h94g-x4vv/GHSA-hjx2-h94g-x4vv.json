  "details": "A vulnerability in the Event Management Service daemon (emsd) of Cisco IOS XR routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on the affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of gRPC requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by repeatedly sending unauthenticated gRPC requests to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to crash the device in such a manner that manual intervention is required to recover. This vulnerability affects all Cisco IOS XR platforms that are running release 6.1.1 of Cisco IOS XR Software when the gRPC service is enabled on the device. The gRPC service is not enabled by default. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvb14441.",
