  "details": "A vulnerability in the CLI command-parsing code of the Cisco StarOS operating system for Cisco ASR 5000 Series 11.0 through 21.0, 5500 Series, and 5700 Series devices and Cisco Virtualized Packet Core (VPC) Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to break from the StarOS CLI of an affected system and execute arbitrary shell commands as a Linux root user on the system, aka Command Injection. The vulnerability exists because the affected operating system does not sufficiently sanitize commands before inserting them into Linux shell commands. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted CLI command for execution in a Linux shell command as a root user. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvc69329, CSCvc72930.",
