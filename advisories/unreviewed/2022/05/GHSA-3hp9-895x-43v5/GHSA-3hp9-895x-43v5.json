  "details": "ELSEIF CMS Beta 0.6 does not properly unset variables when the input data includes a numeric parameter with a value matching an alphanumeric parameter's hash value, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code by uploading a .php file via externe/swfupload/upload.php.  NOTE: it could be argued that this vulnerability is due to a bug in the unset PHP command (CVE-2006-3017) and the proper fix should be in PHP; if so, then this should not be treated as a vulnerability in ELSEIF CMS.",
