It is vulnerable to SQL Injection due to the fact that it is possible to inject malicious SQL statements in malformed parameter types. Sending the improper variable type Array allows a bypass of core SQL Injection sanitization. Users are able to inject malicious statements in multiple functions. This vulnerability leads to full authentication bypass: any unauthorized user with access to the application is able to exploit this vulnerability. This can occur via the Cookie header to the default URI, within includes/authenticate.inc.php.",
