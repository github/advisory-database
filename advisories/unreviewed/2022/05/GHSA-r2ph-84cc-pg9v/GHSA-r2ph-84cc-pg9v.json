  "details": "** DISPUTED **  Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in the lmtg_myhomepage Component (com_lmtg_myhomepage) for Mambo allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the mosConfig_absolute_path parameter in (1) install.lmtg_homepage.php and (2) mtg_homepage.php.  NOTE: this issue has been disputed by a third party, who states that the $mosConfig_absolute_path variable is only used within a function definition.  CVE source code analysis on 20060824 is not conclusive but tends to concur with the dispute.  In addition, it appears that the component name is actually \"lmtg_myhomepage\".",
