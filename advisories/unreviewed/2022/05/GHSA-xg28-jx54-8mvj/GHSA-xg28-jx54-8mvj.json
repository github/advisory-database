  ],
  "details": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the implementation of a specific CLI command for Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker with administrator credentials to cause a buffer overflow condition or perform command injection. This could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with elevated privileges on the underlying operating system of an affected device. The vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of arguments passed to a certain CLI command. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by including malicious input as the argument of the affected CLI command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with root privileges. An attacker would need valid administrator credentials to exploit these vulnerabilities.",
