  "details": "A vulnerability in the web UI of Cisco DNA Spaces: Connector could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries. The vulnerability exists because the web UI does not properly validate user-supplied input.

A successful exploit could allow the attacker to remove the SQL database, which would require the reinstallation of the Connector VM.",
