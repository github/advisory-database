  "details": "xterm on Slackware Linux 10.2 stores information that had been displayed for a different user account using the same xterm process, which might allow local users to bypass file permissions and read other users' files, or obtain other sensitive information, by reading the xterm process memory.  NOTE: it could be argued that this is an expected consequence of multiple users sharing the same interactive process, in which case this is not a vulnerability.",
