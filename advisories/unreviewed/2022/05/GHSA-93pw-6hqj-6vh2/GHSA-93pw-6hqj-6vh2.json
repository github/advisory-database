  "details": "Zebra Industrial Printers All Versions, Zebra printers are shipped with unrestricted end-user access to front panel options. If the option to use a passcode to limit the functionality of the front panel is applied, specially crafted packets could be sent over the same network to a port on the printer and the printer will respond with an array of information that includes the front panel passcode for the printer. Once the passcode is retrieved, an attacker must have physical access to the front panel of the printer to enter the passcode to access the full functionality of the front panel.",
