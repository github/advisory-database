  "details": "CyberGhost 6.5.0.3180 for Windows suffers from a SYSTEM privilege escalation vulnerability through the \"CG6Service\" service. This service establishes a NetNamedPipe endpoint that allows arbitrary installed applications to connect and call publicly exposed methods. The \"ConnectToVpnServer\" method accepts a \"connectionParams\" argument that provides attacker control of the OpenVPN command line. An attacker can specify a dynamic library plugin that should run for every new VPN connection attempt. This plugin will execute code in the context of the SYSTEM user.",
