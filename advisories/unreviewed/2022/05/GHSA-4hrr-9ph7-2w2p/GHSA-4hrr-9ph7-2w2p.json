  "details": "When opening a Hangul Hcell Document (.cell) and processing a property record within the Workbook stream, Hancom Office 2014 will attempt to allocate space for an element using a length from the file. When copying user-supplied data to this buffer, however, the application will use a different size which leads to a heap-based buffer overflow. This vulnerability can lead to code-execution under the context of the application.",
