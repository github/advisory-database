  "details": "The SOAP interface to the eMBox module in Novell eDirectory 8.7.3.9 and earlier, and 8.8.x before 8.8.2, relies on client-side authentication, which allows remote attackers to bypass authentication via requests for /SOAP URIs, and cause a denial of service (daemon shutdown) or read arbitrary files. NOTE: it was later reported that 8.7.3.10 (aka 8.7.3 SP10) is also affected.",
