  "details": "A vulnerability in the web framework code for the SQL database interface of the Cisco Prime Collaboration Provisioning application could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to impact the confidentiality and integrity of the application by executing arbitrary SQL queries, aka SQL Injection. The attacker could read or write information from the SQL database. The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper validation on user-supplied input within SQL queries. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted URLs that contain malicious SQL statements to the affected application. An exploit could allow the attacker to determine the presence of certain values and write malicious input in the SQL database. The attacker would need to have valid user credentials. This vulnerability affects Cisco Prime Collaboration Provisioning Software Releases prior to 12.3. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf47935.",
