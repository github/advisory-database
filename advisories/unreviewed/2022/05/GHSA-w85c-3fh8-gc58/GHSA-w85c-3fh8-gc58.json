  "details": "The ASP.NET debug feature is enabled by default in Kiwi Syslog Server 9.7.2 and previous versions. ASP.NET allows remote debugging of web applications, if configured to do so. Debug mode causes ASP.NET to compile applications with extra information. The information enables a debugger to closely monitor and control the execution of an application. If an attacker could successfully start a remote debugging session, this is likely to disclose sensitive information about the web application and supporting infrastructure that may be valuable in targeting SWI with malicious intent.",
