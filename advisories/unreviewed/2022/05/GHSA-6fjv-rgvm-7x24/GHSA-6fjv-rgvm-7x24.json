  "details": "There exists an unauthenticated BLE Interface in Sloan SmartFaucets including Optima EAF, Optima ETF/EBF, BASYS EFX, and Flushometers including SOLIS. The vulnerability allows for unauthenticated kinetic effects and information disclosure on the faucets. It is possible to use the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connectivity to read and write to many BLE characteristics on the device. Some of these control the flow of water, the sensitivity of the sensors, and information about maintenance.",
