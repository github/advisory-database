  "details": "The Debut embedded http server contains a remotely exploitable denial of service where a single malformed HTTP POST request can cause the server to hang until eventually replying (~300 seconds) with an HTTP 500 error. While the server is hung, print jobs over the network are blocked and the web interface is inaccessible. An attacker can continuously send this malformed request to keep the device inaccessible to legitimate traffic.",
