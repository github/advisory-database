  "details": "The Java client program for the ATEN KH1516i IP KVM switch with firmware 1.0.063 and the KN9116 IP KVM switch with firmware 1.1.104 has a hardcoded AES encryption key, which makes it easier for man-in-the-middle attackers to (1) execute arbitrary Java code, or (2) gain access to machines connected to the switch, by hijacking a session.",
