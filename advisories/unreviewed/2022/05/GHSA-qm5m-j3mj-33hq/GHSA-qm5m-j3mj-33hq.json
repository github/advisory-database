Jamf Pro user accounts and groups with access to log in to Jamf Pro had full access to endpoints in the Universal API (UAPI), regardless of account privileges or privilege sets. An authenticated Jamf Pro account without required privileges could be used to perform CRUD actions (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) on UAPI endpoints, which could result in unauthorized information disclosure, compromised data integrity, and data loss. For a full listing of available UAPI endpoints and associated CRUD actions you can navigate to /uapi/doc in your instance of Jamf Pro.",
