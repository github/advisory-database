  "details": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Contact Center Express could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of the affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information.
