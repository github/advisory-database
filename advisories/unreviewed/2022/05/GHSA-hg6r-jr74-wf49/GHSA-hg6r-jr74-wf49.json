  "details": "An issue was discovered in Oracle WebCenter Interaction Portal 10.3.3. The portal component is delivered with an insecure default User Profile community configuration that allows anonymous users to retrieve the account names of all portal users via /portal/server.pt/user/user/ requests. When WCI is synchronised with Active Directory (AD), this vulnerability can expose the account names of all AD users. NOTE: this CVE is assigned by MITRE and isn't validated by Oracle because Oracle WebCenter Interaction Portal is out of support.",
