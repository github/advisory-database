  "details": "The Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) implementation in unspecified Cisco products and other vendors' products, as used in WPA and WPA2 on Wi-Fi networks, has insufficient countermeasures against certain crafted and replayed packets, which makes it easier for remote attackers to decrypt packets from an access point (AP) to a client and spoof packets from an AP to a client, and conduct ARP poisoning attacks or other attacks, as demonstrated by tkiptun-ng.",
