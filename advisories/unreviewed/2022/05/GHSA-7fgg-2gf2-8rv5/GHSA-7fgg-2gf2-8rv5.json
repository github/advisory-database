  "details": "A vulnerability in the Akamai Connect feature of Cisco Wide Area Application Services (WAAS) Appliances could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to certain file-handling inefficiencies of the affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by directing client systems to access a corrupted file that the client systems cannot decompress correctly. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to crash or hang unexpectedly and result in a DoS condition that may require manual intervention to regain normal operating conditions.
