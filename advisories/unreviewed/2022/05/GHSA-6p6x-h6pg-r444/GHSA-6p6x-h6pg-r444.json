  "details": "An attacker could send an authenticated HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability in Insteon Hub running firmware version 1012. At 0x9d01c2c8 the value for the s_url key is copied using strcpy to the buffer at 0xa0001a0c. This buffer is 16 bytes large, sending anything longer will cause a buffer overflow.
