  "details": "A Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability in BGP in Juniper Networks Junos OS configured as a VPLS PE allows an attacker to craft a specific BGP message to cause the routing protocol daemon (rpd) process to crash and restart. While rpd restarts after a crash, repeated crashes can result in an extended DoS condition. This issue only affects PE routers configured with BGP Auto discovery for LDP VPLS. Other BGP configurations are unaffected by this vulnerability. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS: 12.1X46 versions prior to 12.1X46-D81; 12.3 versions prior to 12.3R12-S12; 12.3X48 versions prior to 12.3X48-D76; 14.1X53 versions prior to 14.1X53-D48; 15.1 versions prior to 15.1F6-S12, 15.1R7-S2; 15.1X49 versions prior to 15.1X49-D150; 15.1X53 versions prior to 15.1X53-D235, 15.1X53-D495, 15.1X53-D590, 15.1X53-D68; 16.1 versions prior to 16.1R3-S10, 16.1R4-S12, 16.1R6-S6, 16.1R7-S1; 16.2 versions prior to 16.2R2-S7; 17.1 versions prior to 17.1R2-S9, 17.1R3; 17.2 versions prior to 17.2R1-S7, 17.2R2-S6, 17.2R3; 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R2-S4, 17.3R3; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R1-S5, 17.4R2; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R2-S3, 18.1R3.",
