  "details": "A vulnerability in the web-based dashboard of Cisco Umbrella could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform an email enumeration attack against the Umbrella infrastructure. This vulnerability is due to an overly descriptive error message on the dashboard that appears when a user attempts to modify their email address when the new address already exists in the system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to modify the user's email address. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to enumerate email addresses of users in the system.",
