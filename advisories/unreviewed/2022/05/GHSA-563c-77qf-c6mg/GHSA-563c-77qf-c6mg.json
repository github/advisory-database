  "details": "Cisco Unified Communications Manager (CUCM) 7.1(x) through 9.1(2) and the IM & Presence Service in Cisco Unified Presence Server through 9.1(2) use the same CTI and database-encryption key across different customers' installations, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to defeat cryptographic protection mechanisms by leveraging knowledge of this key, aka Bug IDs CSCsc69187 and CSCui01756.  NOTE: the vendor has provided a statement that the \"hard-coded static encryption key is considered a hardening issue rather than a vulnerability, and as such, has a CVSS score of 0/0.\"",
