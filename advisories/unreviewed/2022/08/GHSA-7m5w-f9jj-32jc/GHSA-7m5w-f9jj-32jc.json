A remote unauthenticated malicious Archer user could potentially exploit this vulnerability by tricking a victim application user into supplying malicious JavaScript code to the vulnerable web application. This code is then reflected to the victim and gets executed by the web browser in the context of the vulnerable web application. 6.10 P4 (6.10.0.4) and 6.11 P2 HF4 (6.11.0.2.4) are also fixed releases.",
