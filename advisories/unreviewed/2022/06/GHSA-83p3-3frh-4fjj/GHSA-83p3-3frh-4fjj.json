  "details": "A vulnerability in Cisco Unified IP Phones could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to impersonate another user's phone if the Cisco Unified Communications Manager (CUCM) is in secure mode. This vulnerability is due to improper key generation during the manufacturing process that could result in duplicated manufactured keys installed on multiple devices. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by performing a machine-in-the-middle attack on the secure communication between the phone and the CUCM. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to impersonate another user's phone. This vulnerability cannot be addressed with software updates. There is a workaround that addresses this vulnerability.",
