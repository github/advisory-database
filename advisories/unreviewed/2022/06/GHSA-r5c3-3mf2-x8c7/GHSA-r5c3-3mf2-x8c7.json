  "details": "libcurl wrongly allows cookies to be set for Top Level Domains (TLDs) if thehost name is provided with a trailing dot.curl can be told to receive and send cookies. curl's \"cookie engine\" can bebuilt with or without [Public Suffix List](https://publicsuffix.org/)awareness. If PSL support not provided, a more rudimentary check exists to atleast prevent cookies from being set on TLDs. This check was broken if thehost name in the URL uses a trailing dot.This can allow arbitrary sites to set cookies that then would get sent to adifferent and unrelated site or domain.",
